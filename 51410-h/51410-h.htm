<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> story of Elsie Inglis needs little introduction.
From first to last she was the woman nobly planned.
She achieved what she did because she was ready
when the opportunity came. Consistently she had
lived her life, doing whatever her hand found to do
with all her might, and ever following the light.
She had the spirit of her nation and of her race:
the spirit of courageous adventure, the love of
liberty, and equal freedom for all people.</p>

<p>If this memoir represents her faithfully, it is
because it has been written among her own family
and kindred. Every letter or story of her is part
of a consistent whole. Transparently honest,
warmly affectioned to all, the record could hardly
err if, following exactly her footprints in the sands
of time, it presents a portrait of one of old Scotia’s
truest daughters. I owe manifold thanks to her
sisters, her friends, her patients, above all, to her
Units, for the help they have given me in what has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
been a labour of love and growing respect. She,
being dead, yet speaketh; and, while we thank our
God for every remembrance of her, we hope that
those who are her living memorials, the patients in
the Hospice, and the Scottish Women’s Hospitals,
will not be forgotten by those who read and pass
on the pilgrim way.</p>

<p>The design for the book cover has been drawn
by Dr. Inglis’ countryman, Mr. Anning Bell. It
is the emblem of her nation and of the S.W.H.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Among</span> the records of the family from whom Elsie
Inglis was descended there are letters which date
back to 1740. In that year the property of Kingsmills,
Inverness-shire, was in the hands of Hugh
Inglis. He had three sons, George, Alexander,
and William. George inherited Kingsmills, and
the Inglis now in Inverness are descended from
him. Alexander, the great-grandfather of Elsie,
married Mary Deas, and about 1780 emigrated to
Carolina, leaving his four children to be educated
in Scotland, in charge of his brother, William
Inglis. The portrait of Alexander, in the dress of
the period, has the characteristic features of the
race descended from him. The face is stamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
with the impress of a resolute, fearless character,
one who was likely to leave his mark on any
country in which he took up his abode. There
is an account of the property and estates of Alexander
Inglis of Charleston ‘merchant in his own
right.’ The account sets forth how the estates are
confiscated on account of the loyalty of the said
Alexander, and his adherence to, and support of
the British Government and constitution.</p>

<p>In the schedule of property there occur, in close
relation, these items: 125 head of black cattle,
<abbr title="125 pounds">£125</abbr>; 69 slaves at <abbr title="60 pounds">£60</abbr> a head, <abbr title="4140 pounds">£4140</abbr>; a pew,
No. 31 in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Church, Charleston, <abbr title="150 pounds">£150</abbr>;
11 house negroes, <abbr title="700 pounds">£700</abbr>; and a library of well-chosen
books, at a much lower figure. Alexander
never lost sight of the four children left in his
native land. In 1784 he congratulates his son
David on being Dux of his class, and says that he
prays constantly for him.</p>

</div>

<p>Mary Deas, Alexander Inglis’ wife, through her
ancestor Sir David Dundas, was a direct descendant
of Robert the Bruce. All that is known of
her life is contained in the undated obituary notice
of the American newspaper of the day:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘The several duties of her station in life she discharged
as became the good Christian, supporting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
exemplary fortitude the late trying separation from
her family.’</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Alexander’s restless and adventurous life was
soon to have a violent end.</p>

<p>After their mother’s death, the three daughters
must have joined their father in America. One
of them, Katherine, whose face has been immortalised
by Raeburn, writes to her brother David,
who had been left in Scotland, to inform him of
the death of their father in a duel.</p>

   <span class="sub_head">GREAT-AUNT OF DR. ELSIE INGLIS<br /></span>
   <span class="sub_head3">(<i>Portrait by Raeburn</i>)</span></p>
</div>

<p>The letter which Alexander Inglis wrote to be
given to his children, should he fall in the duel,
is as fresh and clear as on the day when it was
written:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My dear, dear Children</span>,&mdash;If ever you receive
this letter it will be after my death. You were present
this morning when I received the grossest insult that
could be offered me&mdash;and such as I little expected
from the young man who dared to offer it. Could
the epithets which in his passion he ventured to make
use of be properly applied to me&mdash;I would not wish to
live another hour, but as a man of honour, and the
natural guardian and protector of everything that is
dear and valuable to myself and to you, I have no
alternative left, but that of demanding reparation for
the injury I have received. If I fall&mdash;I do so in
defence of that honour, which is dearer to me than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
life. May that great, gracious and good Being, who is
the protector of innocence, and the sure rewarder of
goodness, bless, preserve and keep you.&mdash;I am, my
dear, dear children, your affectionate father,</p>

<p class="place_date">‘<span class="smcap">Charleston</span>,<br />
‘<i>Tuesday evening, 29 March 1791</i>.’
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The letter is addressed by name to the four
children.</p>

<p>Katherine writes to her brother David in the

<blockquote>

<p>‘In what manner, my dearest brother, shall I relate
to you the melancholy event that has befallen us. Our
dear parent, the best of fathers, is no more. How
shall I go on? Alas! you will hear too soon by whose
hand he fell; therefore I will not distress you with the
particulars of his death. The second day of our dear
father’s illness he called us to his bedside, when he told
us he had left a letter for us three and his dear boy
which would explain all things. Judge if you are able,
my dear brother, what must have been our thoughts
on this sad occasion to see our only dear parent tortured
with the most excruciating pains and breathing his
last. We were all of us too young, my brother, to
experience the heavy loss we met with when our dear
mother died, we had then a good father to supply our
wants. I have always thought the Almighty kind to
all His creatures, but more so in this particular that
He seldom deprives us of one friend without raising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
another to comfort us. My dear sisters and self are
at present staying with good Mrs. Jamieson, who is
indeed a truly amiable woman. I am sure you will
regard her for your sisters’ sakes. You are happily
placed, my brother, under the care of kind uncles and
aunts who will no doubt (as they ever have done) prove
all you have lost. How happy would it make me in my
present situation to be among my friends in Scotland,
but as that is impossible for some time I must endeavour
to be as happy as I can. My kind duty to uncle and
aunts.&mdash;I am, my dearest brother, your truly affectionate
sister,</p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus closes the chapter of Alexander Inglis
and Mary Deas, his wife, both ‘long, long ago at
rest’ in the land of their exile, both bearing the
separation with fortitude, and the one rendering
his children fatherless rather than live insulted by
some nameless and graceless youth.</p>

<p>David Inglis grew up in charge of the kind Uncle
William, and endeared himself to his adopted father.
He also was to fare to dominions beyond the sea,
and he carried the name of Inglis to India, where
he went in 1798 as writer to the East India
Company.</p>

<p>Uncle William followed him with the usual good
advice. In a letter he tells David he expects him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to make a fortune in India that will give him
‘<abbr title="3000 pounds">£3000</abbr> a year, that being the lowest sum on which
it is possible to live in comfort.’</p>

<p>David’s life was a more adventurous one than
that which usually falls to a writer. He went
through the Mahratta War in 1803. He left India
in 1812. On applying for a sick certificate, the
resolution of Council, dated 1811, draws the
attention of the Honourable Company to his services,
‘most particularly when selected to receive
charge of the territorial cessions of the Peshwa
under the Treaty of Bassein in the year 1803, displaying
in the execution of that delicate and
difficult mission, proofs of judgment and talents
with moderation and firmness combined, which
averted the necessity of having recourse to coercive
measures, accomplished the peaceable transfer of
a valuable territory, and conciliated those whose
power and consequence were annihilated or abridged
by the important change he so happily effected.’
David Inglis seems to have roamed through India,
always seeking new worlds to conquer, and confident
in his own powers to achieve.</p>

<p>One of the Napoleonic invasion scares alarmed
the Company, and David, with two companions,
was sent out on a cruising expedition to see if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
could sight the enemy’s fleet. As long as he wrote
from India, his letters bear the stamp of a man
full of vital energy and resource.</p>

<p>The only thing he did not accomplish while in
the service of the Company was the fortune of
<abbr title="3000 pounds">£3000</abbr> a year.</p>

<p>He entered a business firm in Bombay and there
made enough to be able to keep a wife. In 1806 he
married Martha Money, whose father was a partner
in the firm. They came home in 1812, and all their
younger children were born in England at Walthamstow,
the home of the Money family. One of the
descendants, who has read the letters of these three
brothers and their families, makes this comment
on them:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘The letters are pervaded with a sense of activity,
and of wandering. Each one entering into any pursuit
that came to hand. All the family were travellers.
There are letters from aunts in Gibraltar and many
other airts.</p>

<p>‘The extraordinary thing in all the letters, whether
they were written by an Inglis, a Deas, or a Money,
is the pervading note of strong religious faith. They
not only refer to religion, but often, in truly Scottish
fashion they enter on long theological dissertations.
David Inglis, Elsie’s grandfather, when he was settled
in England gave missionary addresses. Two of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
exist, and must have taken fully an hour to read. Even
the restless Alexander in Carolina, and the “whirlwind”
David in India scarcely ever write a letter without
a reference to some religious topic. You get the impression
of strong breezy men sure of themselves, and
finding the world a great playground.’</p>

<p>John, the second youngest son of David and
Martha Inglis, was born in 1820. His mother
being English, there entered with her some of the
douce Saxon disposition and ways. Though the
call of the blood was to cast his lot in India, John,
or as he was generally called David, appears first
as a student. His tutor, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Niblock,
wrote a report of him as he was passing out of his
hands to Haileybury. Mrs. Inglis notes on the
letter: ‘Dr. Niblock is esteemed one of the best
Greek scholars in England, and his Greek Grammar
is the one in use in Eton.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Of Master David Inglis I can speak with pleasure
and pride almost unmixed. I can only loudly express
how I regret that I have not the finishing of
such a boy, for I feel, and shall ever feel, that he is
<em>mine</em>. He has long begun to do what few boys do
till they are leaving, or have left, school, viz. to think.
I shall long cherish the hope, that as I laid the foundation,
so shall I have the power and pleasure of crowning
my own and other’s labours. He will make a fine
fellow and be a comfort to his parents, and an honour
to his tutor.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John Inglis received a nomination for Haileybury
College from one of the directors of the East
India Company, and went there as a student in
1839. There he was noted as a cricketer and
a good horseman, and also for his reading. He
knew Shakespeare almost by heart, and could tell
where to find any quotation from his works. On
leaving Haileybury he sailed for Calcutta, and was
there for two years learning the language. He
went as assistant magistrate to Agra. He married
in 1846, and in 1847 he was transferred to the
newly-acquired province of the Punjab. He was
sent as magistrate to Sealkote, remaining there
till 1856. He then brought his family home on
three years’ furlough. With the outbreak of the
Mutiny all civilians were recalled, and he returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to India in 1858. He was sent to Bareilly to take
part in the suppression of the Mutiny, and was
attached to the force under General Jones. He
was present at the action at Najibabad, with the
recapture of Bareilly, and the pacification of the
province of Rohilcund. He remained in the province
ten years till 1868, and during those years he
rose to be Commissioner of Rohilcund. In 1868
he was made a member of the Board of Revenue
in the North-West Provinces. As a member of the
Legislative Council of India, he moved, in 1873,
to Calcutta. From 1875 to 1877 he was Chief
Commissioner of Oude.</p>

<p>The position Inglis made for himself in India,
in yet early life, is to be gauged by a letter written
in 1846 by Sir Frederick Currie, who was then
Commissioner of Lahore. He had married Mrs.
Inglis’ sister Katherine.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘We have applied to Mr. Thomasen (Lieutenant-Governor
of the N.W.P.) for young civilians for the
work which is now before us, and we must take several
with us into the Punjab. One whom he strongly
recommends is Inglis at Agra. I will copy what he
says about him. Sir Henry Hardinge (the Governor-General)
has not seen the letter yet. “Another man
who might suit you is Inglis at Agra; an assistant
on <abbr title="400 pounds">£400</abbr>, acting as joint magistrate which gives him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
one hundred more. Active, energetic, conciliating
to natives, fine-tempered, and thoroughly honest in
all his works. I am not sure that he is not as good a
man as you can have. I shall be glad to hear that you
send for him.”’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The letter was addressed to Inglis’ eighteen-year-old
bride, and Sir Frederick goes on:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Shall I send for him or not? I am almost sure I
should have done so, had I not heard of your getting
hold of his heart. We don’t want <em>heartless</em> men, but
really you have no right to keep <em>such</em> a man from us.
At the present moment, however, for your sake, little
darling, I won’t take him from his present work, but
if, after the honeymoon, he would prefer active and
stirring employment, with the prospect of distinction,
to the light-winged toys of feathered cupid, I dare say
I shall be able to find an opening for him.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Inglis’ wife was Harriet Louis Thompson,
one of nine daughters. Her father was one of the
first Indian civilians in the old company’s days.
All of the nine sisters married men in the Indian
Civil, with the exception of one who married an
army officer. Harriet came out to her parents in
India when she was seventeen, and she married in
her eighteenth year. She must have been a girl
of marked character and ability. She met her
future husband at a dance in her father’s house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and she appears to have been the first to introduce
the waltz into India. She was a fine rider, and
often drove tandem in India. She must have had
a steady nerve, for her letters are full of various
adventures in camp and tiger-haunted jungles, and
most of them narrate the presence of one of her
infants who was accompanying the parents on their
routine of Indian official life.</p>

<p>Her daughter says of her:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘She was deeply religious. Some years after their
marriage, when she must have been a little over thirty
and was alone in England with the six elder children,
she started and ran most successfully a large working-men’s
club in Southampton. Such a thing was not
as common as it is to-day. There she lectured on
Sunday evenings on religious subjects to the crowded
hall of men.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the perfectly happy home of the Inglis family
in India, the Indian ayah was one of the household
in love and service to those she served. Mrs.
Simson has supplied some memories of this faithful
retainer:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘The early days, the nursery days in the life of a
family, are always looked back upon with loving
interest, and many of us can trace to them many
sweet and helpful influences. So it was with our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
early days, though the nursery was in India, and the
dear nurse who lives in our memories was an Indian.
Her name was Sona (Gold). She came into our family
when the eldest of us was born, and remained one
of the household for more than thirty years. Her
husband came with her, and in later years three of her
sons were table servants. Sona came home with us in
1857, and remained in England till the beginning of
1858. It was a sign of great attachment to us, for she
left her own family away up in the Punjab, and fared
out in the long sea voyage, into a strange country and
among new peoples. She made friends wherever she
was, and her stay in England was a great help to her
in after life. When I returned to India after my
school life at home, I found the dear nurse of my
childhood days installed again as nurse to the little
sisters and brother I found there.</p>

<p>‘She was a sweet, gentle woman, and we never learnt
anything but kind, gentle ways from her. By the time
I returned she was recognised by the whole compound
of servants as one to be looked up to and respected.
She became a Christian and was baptized in 1877, but
long before she made profession of her faith by baptism
she lived a consistent Christian life. My dear mother’s
influence was strong with her, and she was a reader
of the Bible. One of my earliest recollections is our
reading together the fourteenth chapter of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John.</p>

<p>‘She died some years after we had all settled in
Scotland. My parents left her, with a small pension
for life, in charge of the missionaries at Lucknow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
When she died, they wrote to us saying that old Sona
had been one of the pillars of the Indian Christian
Church in Lucknow.</p>

<p>‘We look forward with a sure and certain hope to
our reunion in the home of many mansions, with her,
around whom our hearts still cling with love and
affection.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1856 Mr. Inglis resolved to come home on
furlough, accompanied by Mrs. Inglis, and what was
called ‘the first family,’ namely, the six boys and
one girl born to them in India. It was a formidable
journey to accomplish even without children,
and one writes, ‘How mother stood it all I cannot
imagine.’ They came down from the Punjab to
Calcutta trekking in dâk garris. It took four
months to reach Calcutta by this means of progression,
and another four months to come home
by the Cape. The wonderful ayah, Sona, was a
great help in the toilsome journey when they
brought the children back to England. Mrs.
Inglis was soon to have her first parting with her
husband. When they landed in England, news
of the outbreak of the Mutiny met them, and Mr.
Inglis returned almost at once to take his place
beside John Lawrence. Together they fought
through the Mutiny, and then he worked under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
him. Inglis was one of John Lawrence’s men in
the great settling of the Punjab which followed on
that period of stress and strain in the Empire of
India. His own district was Bareilly, and the
house where he lived in Sealkote is still known as
Inglis Sahib ke koti (Inglis Sahib’s house). His
children remember the thrilling stories he used to
tell them of these great days, and of the great
men who made their history.</p>

<p>His admiration was unbounded for those northern
races of India. He loved and respected them, and
they, in their turn, gave him unbounded confidence
and affection. ‘Every bit as good as an Englishman,’
was a phrase often on his lips when speaking
of the fine Sikhs and Punjabis and Rajpoots.</p>

<p>Englishwomen were not allowed in India during
this period, and Mrs. Inglis had to remain in
Southampton with her six children and their ayah.
It was then that she found work in her leisure time
for the work she did in the Men’s Club.</p>

<p>In 1863, when life in India had resumed its
normal course, Mrs. Inglis rejoined her husband,
leaving the children she had brought back at home.</p>

<p>It must have taken all the ‘fortitude’ that
Mary Deas had shown long before in Carolina to
face this separation. There was no prospect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the running backwards and forwards, which steam
was so soon to develop, and to draw the dominions
into closer bonds. Letters took months to pass,
and no cable carried the messages of life and death
across ‘the white-lipped seas.’ Again, one of the
survivors says: ‘I always felt even as a child,
and am sure of it now, she left her heart behind
with the six elder children. What it must have
meant to a woman of her deep nature, I cannot
imagine.’ The decision was made, and Mr. Inglis
was to have the great reward of her return to him,
after his seven years of strenuous and anxious
loneliness. The boys were sent, three of them to
Eton, and two more to Uppingham and to Rugby.
Amy Inglis the daughter was left with friends.
Relatives were not lacking in this large clan and
its branches, and the children were ‘looked after’
by them. We owe much of our knowledge of ‘the
second little family,’ which were to comfort the
parents in India, by the correspondence concerning
them with the dearly-loved children left in the
homelands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Inglis writes a long account of Elsie at a
month old, and says she is supposed to have a
temper, as she makes herself heard all over the
house, and strongly objects to being brought
indoors and put into her cradle.</p>

<p>In October she writes how the two babies, her
own and Aunt Ellen’s little boy, had been taken
to church to be baptized, the one by the name of
Elsie Maude, the other Cyril Powney. Both children
were thriving, and no one would know that
there were two babies in the house. ‘Elsie always
stares very hard at papa when he comes to speak
to her, as if she did not quite know what to make
of his black beard, something different to what she
is accustomed to see, but she generally ends by
laughing at him’&mdash;the first notice of that radiant
friendship in which father and daughter were to
journey together in a happy pilgrimage through
life.</p>

<p>Elsie had early to make long driving expeditions
with her parents, and her mother reports her as
‘accommodating herself to circumstances, watching
the trees, sleeping under them, and the jolliest
little traveller I ever saw.’</p>

<p>In December 1864 Mrs. Inglis reports their
return from camp:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘It has been most extraordinarily warm for the time
of year, and there has been very little rain during
the whole twelvemonth. People attribute it to the
wonderful comet which has been visible in the southern
hemisphere. Elsie is very well, but she is a very little
thing with a very wee face. She has a famous pair
of large blue eyes, and it is quite remarkable how she
looks about her and seems to observe everything.
She lies in her bed at night in the dark and talks away
out loud in her own little language, and little voice,
and she is always ready for a laugh.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later on Mrs. Inglis writes: ‘I think she is one
of the most intelligent babies I ever met with.’</p>

<p>Every letter descriptive of the dark, blue-eyed
baby with the fast growing light hair, speaks of
the smile ready for every one who speaks to her,
and the hearty laughs which seem to have been
one of her earliest characteristics.</p>

<p>One journey tried Elsie’s philosophy of taking
life as she found it. Mrs. Inglis writes to her
daughter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date">
<span class="smcap">Naini Tal</span>, 1865.
</p>

<p>‘We came in palkies from Beharin to a place called
Jeslie, half way up the hill to Naini Tal, and were
about ten hours in the palkies. I had arranged to
have Elsie with me in my palkie, but the little monkey
did not like being away from Sona, and then the
strangeness of the whole proceedings bewildered her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and the noise of the bearers seemed to frighten her,
so I was obliged to make her over to Sona. She went
to sleep after a little while. As we came near the hills
it became cold and a wind got up, and then Papa
brought her back to me, for we did not quite like her
being in Sona’s doolie, which was not so well protected
as mine. She had become more reconciled to the
disagreeables of dâk travelling by that time. We
reached our house about nine o’clock yesterday morning.
The change from the dried-up hot plains is very
pleasant. You may imagine how often I longed for
the railroad and our civilised English way of travelling.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Shaw M‘Laren, the companion sister of
Elsie, and to whom her correspondence always
refers, has written down some memories of the happy
childhood days in India. The year was divided
between the plains and the hills of India. Elsie
was born in August 1864, at Naini Tal, one of the
most beautiful hill stations in the Himalayas.
From the verandah, where much of the day was
spent, the view was across the masses of ‘huddled
hills’ to the ranges crowned by the everlasting
snows. An outlook of silent and majestic stillness,
and one which could not fail to influence
such a spirit as shone out in the always wonderful
eyes of Elsie. She grew up with the vision of the
glory of the earthly dominion, and it gave a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
meaning to the kingdom of the things of the
spirit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘All our childhood is full of remembrances of
“Father.” He never forgot our birthdays; however
hot it was down in the scorched plains, when the day
came round, if we were up in the hills, a large parcel
would arrive from him. His very presence was joy
and strength when he came to us at Naini Tal.
What a remembrance there is of early walks and early
breakfasts with him and the three of us. The table
was spread in the verandah between six and seven.
Father made three cups of cocoa, one for each of us,
and then the glorious walk! Three ponies followed
behind, each with their attendant grooms, and two or
three red-coated chaprasis, father stopping all along
the road to talk to every native who wished to speak
to him, while we three ran about, laughing and interested
in everything. Then, at night, the shouting
for him after we were in bed and father’s step bounding
up the stair in Calcutta, or coming along the matted
floor of our hill home. All order and quietness flung
to the winds while he said good night to us.</p>

<p>‘It was always understood that Elsie and he were
special chums, but that never made any jealousy.
Father was always just! The three cups of cocoa were
exactly the same in quality and quantity. We got
equal shares of his right and his left hand in our walks,
but Elsie and he were comrades, inseparables from the
day of her birth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>‘In the background of our lives there was always
the quiet strong mother, whose eyes and smile live on
through the years. Every morning before the breakfast
and walk, there were five minutes when we sat in front
of her in a row on little chairs in her room and read the
scripture verses in turn, and then knelt in a straight,
quiet row and repeated the prayers after her. Only
once can I remember father being angry with any of
us, and that was when one of us ventured to hesitate in
instant obedience to some wish of hers. I still see the
room in which it happened, and the thunder in his voice
is with me still.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Inglis belonged to the
Anglican Church, though they never hesitated to
go to any denomination where they found the best
spiritual life. In later life in Edinburgh, they
were connected with the Free Church of Scotland.
To again quote from his daughter: ‘His religious
outlook was magnificently broad and beautiful,
and his belief in God simple and profound. His
devotion to our mother is a thing impossible to
speak about, but we all feel that in some intangible
way it influenced and beautified our childhood.’</p>

<p>In 1870 Mrs. Inglis writes of the lessons of Elsie
and her sister Eva. ‘The governess, Mrs. Marwood,
is successful as a teacher; it comes easy
enough to Elsie to learn, and she delights in stories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
being told her. Every morning after their early
morning walk, and while their baths are being got
ready, their mother says they come to her to say
their prayers and learn their Bible lesson.’ There
are two letters more or less composed by Elsie and
written by her father. In as far as they were
dictated by herself, they take stock of independent
ways, and the spirit of the Pharisee is early developed
in the courts of the Lord’s House, as she
manages not to fall asleep all the time, while the
weaker little sister slumbers and sleeps.</p>

<p>Eva, the sleepy sister, has some further reminiscences
of these nursery days:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘We had forty dolls! Elsie decreed once that they
should all have measles&mdash;so days were spent by us
three painting little red dots all over the forty faces
and the forty pairs of arms and legs. She was the
doctor and prescribed gruesome drugs which we had
to administer. Then it was decreed that they should
slowly recover, so each day so many spots were washed
off until the epidemic was wiped out!</p>

<p>‘Another time one of the forty dolls was lost! Maria
was small and ugly, but much loved, and the search
for her was <em>tremendous</em>, but unsuccessful. The younger
sister gave it up. After all there were plenty other
dolls&mdash;never mind Maria! But Elsie stuck to it.
Maria must be found. Father would find her when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
he came home from Kutcherry in the evening, if nobody
else could. So father was told with many tears of
Maria’s disappearance. He agreed&mdash;Maria must be
found. The next day all the enormous staff of Indian
servants, numbering all told about thirty or so, were
had up in a row and told that unless Maria was found
sixpence would be cut from each servant’s pay for interminable
months! <em>What</em> a search ensued! and Maria
came to light within half an hour&mdash;in the pocket of
one of the dresses of her little mistress found by one of
the ayahs! Her mistress declared at the time, and
always maintained with undiminished certainty, that
she had first been put there, and then found by the
ayah in question during that half-hour’s search!’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These reminiscences have more of interest than
just the picture of the little child who was to
carry on the early manifestations of a keen interest
in life. A smile, surely one of the clouds of glory
she trailed from heaven, and carried back untarnished
by the tragedies of a stricken earth; they
are chiefly valuable in the signs of a steadfast,
independent will. The interest of all Elsie’s early
development lay in the comradeship with a father
whose wide benevolence and understanding love
was to be the guide and helper in his daughter’s
career. Not for the first time in the history of
outstanding lives, the daughter has been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
friend, and not the subjugated child of a selfish
and dominant parent.</p>

<p>The date of Elsie’s birth was in the dawn of the
movement which believed it possible that women
could have a mind and a brain of their own, and
that the freedom of the one and the cultivation
of the other was not a menace to the possessive
rights of the family, or the ruin of society at large.
Thousands of women born at the same date were
instructed that the aim of their lives must be to
see to the creature comforts of their male parent,
and when he was taken from them, to believe it
right that he had neither educated them, nor made
provision for the certain old age and spinsterdom
which lay before the majority.</p>

<p>There have been many parents who gave their
daughters no reason to call them blessed, when
they were left alone unprovided with gear or education.
In all periods of family history, such
instances as Mr. Inglis’ outlook for his daughters
is uncommon. He desired for them equal opportunities,
and the best and highest education. He
gave them the best of his mind, not its dregs, and
a comradeship which made a rare and happy
entrance for them into life’s daily toil and struggle.
The father asked for nothing but their love, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
he had his own unselfish devotion returned to him
a hundredfold.</p>

<p>It must have been a great joy to him to watch
the unfolding of talent and great gifts in this
daughter who was always ‘his comrade.’ He
could not live to see the end of a career so blessed,
so rich in womanly grace and sustaining service,
but he knew he had spared no good thing he could
bring into her life, and when her mission was
fulfilled, then, those who read and inwardly digest
these pages will feel that she first learnt the secret
of service to mankind in the home of her father.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">After</span> Mr. Inglis had been Chief Commissioner of
Oude, he decided to retire from his long and
arduous service. Had he been given the Lieutenant-Governorship
of the North-West, as was
expected by some in the service, he would probably
have accepted it and remained longer in
India. He was not in sympathy with Lord
Lytton’s Afghan policy, and that would naturally
alter his desire for further employment.</p>

<p>As with his father before him, his work was
highly appreciated by those he served. Lord
Lytton, the Viceroy, in a letter to Lord Salisbury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
then Secretary of State for India, writes, February
1876:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘During the short period of my own official tenure
I have met with much valuable assistance from Mr.
Inglis, both as a member of my Legislative Council,
and also as officiating Commissioner in Oudh, more
especially as regards the amalgamation of Oudh with
the <abbr title="North West">N.W.</abbr> Provinces. Of his character and abilities
I have formed so high an opinion that had there been
an available vacancy I should have been glad to secure
to my government his continued services.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two of Mr. Inglis’ sons had settled in Tasmania,
and it was decided to go there before bringing
home the younger members of his family. The
eldest daughter, Mrs. Simson, was now married and
settled in Edinburgh, and the Inglis determined
to make their home in that city.</p>

<p>Two years were spent in Hobart settling the two
sons on the land. Mrs. M‘Laren says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘When in Tasmania, Elsie and I went to a very good
school. Miss Knott, the head-mistress, had come out
from Cheltenham College for Girls. Here in the days
when such things were practically unknown, Elsie,
backed by Miss Knott, instituted ‘school colours.’
They were very primitive, not beautiful hatbands,
but two inches of blue and white ribbon sewn on to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
safety pin, and worn on the lapel of our coats. How
proud we were of them.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Inglis, writing to his daughter in Edinburgh,
says of their school life:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Elsie has done very well, she is in the second class
and last week got up to second in the class.</p>

<p>‘We are all in a whirl having to sort and send off
our boxes, some round the Cape, some to Melbourne,
and some to go with us.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Inglis, on board the <i>Durham</i> homeward
bound, writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Elsie has found occupation for herself in helping
to nurse sick children, and look after turbulent boys who
trouble everybody on board, and a baby of seven
months old is an especial favourite with her. Eva
has met with a bosom friend in a little girl named
Pearly Macmillan, without whom she would have
collapsed altogether. Our vessel is not a fast one, but
we have been only five instead of six weeks getting to
Suez.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The family took a house at 70 Bruntsfield Place,
and the two girls were soon at school. Mrs.
M‘Laren says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘Elsie and I used to go daily to the Charlotte Square
Institution, which used in those days to be the Edinburgh
school for girls. Mr. Oliphant was headmaster.
Father never approved of the Scotch custom of children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
walking long distances to school, and we used to be
sent every morning in a cab. The other day, when
telling the story of the S.W.H.’s to a large audience of
working women in Edinburgh, one woman said to me,
“My husband is a prood man the day! He tells
everybody how he used to drive Dr. Inglis to school
every morning when she was a girl.”’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of her school life in Edinburgh, Miss Wright
gives these memories:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I remember quite distinctly when the girls of 23
Charlotte Square were told that two girls from Tasmania
were coming to the school, and a certain feeling of
surprise that the said girls were just like ordinary
mortals, though the big, earnest brows and the quaint
hair parted in the middle and done up in plaits fastened
up at the back of the head were certainly not ordinary.
Elsie was put in a higher English class than I was in,
and though I knew her, I did not know her very well.</p>

<p>‘A friend has a story of a question going round the
class, she thinks Clive or Warren Hastings was the
subject of the lesson, and the question was what one
would do if a calumny were spread about one. “Deny
it,” one girl answered. “Fight it,” another. Still the
teacher went on asking. “Live it down,” said Elsie.
“Right, Miss Inglis.” My friend writes, “The question
I cannot remember, it was the bright confident smile
with the answer, and Mr. Hossack’s delighted wave to
the top of the class that abides in my memory.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I always think a very characteristic story of Elsie
is her asking that the school might have permission to
play in Charlotte Square gardens. In those days no
one thought of providing fresh air exercise for girls
except by walks, and tennis was just coming in. Elsie
had the courage (to us schoolgirls it seemed the extraordinary
courage) to confront the three directors of
the school and ask if we might be allowed to play in the
gardens of the Square. The three directors together
were to us the most formidable and awe-inspiring
body, though separately they were amiable and
estimable men!</p>

<p>‘The answer was we might play in the gardens if
the neighbouring proprietors would give their consent,
and the heroic Elsie, with I think one other girl, actually
went round to each house in the Square and asked
consent of the owner.</p>

<p>‘In those days the inhabitants of Charlotte Square
were very select and exclusive indeed, and we all felt
it was a brave thing to do. Elsie gained her point,
and the girls played at certain hours in the Square
till a regular playing field was arranged.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her sister Eva reports that the first answer of
the directors was enough for the rest of the school.
But Elsie, undaunted, interviewed each of the
three directors herself. After every bell in Charlotte
Square had been rung and all interviewed,
she returned from this great expedition triumphant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
All had consented, so the damsels interned from
nine to three were given the gardens, and the
grim, dull, palisaded square must have suddenly
been made to blossom like the rose. Would that
some follower of Elsie Inglis even now might ring
the door bells and get the gates unlocked to the
rising generation. Elsie’s companion or companions
in this first attempt to influence those in
authority have been spoken of as ‘her first
unit.’</p>

<p>Elsie was, for a time, joint editor of the <cite>Edina</cite>,
a school magazine of the ordinary type. Her great
achievement was in making it pay, which, it is
recorded, no other editor was able to do. There
are various editorial anxieties alluded to in her
correspondence with her father. The memories
quoted take us further than school days, but they
find a fitting place here.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘Our more intimate acquaintance came after Mrs.
Inglis’ death and when Elsie was thinking of and
beginning her medical work. In 1888 six of us girls
who had been at the same school started the “Six
Sincere Students Society,” which met in one house.
The first year we read and discussed Emerson’s Essays
on “<cite class="plain">Self-Reliance</cite> and <cite class="plain">Heroism</cite>.” I am pretty sure
it was Elsie who suggested those Essays. Also, Helps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and Matthew Arnold’s <cite>Culture and Anarchy</cite>. I have
a note on this “two very hot discussions as to what
Culture means, and if it is sufficiently powerful to
regenerate the world. Culture of the masses and also
of women largely gone into.”</p>

<p>‘This very friendly and happy society lasted on
till 1891, when it was enlarged and became a Debating
Society. I find Elsie taking up such subjects as “That
our modern civilisation is a development not a degeneration.”
“That character is formed in a busy life rather
than in solitude.” Papers on Henry Drummond’s
<cite>Ascent of Man</cite>, and on the “Ethics of War.”</p>

<p>‘Always associated with Elsie in those days I think
of her father, and no biography of her will be true which
does not emphasise the beautiful and deep love and
sympathy between Elsie and Mr. Inglis. He used
to meet us girls as if we were his intellectual equals,
and would discuss problems and answer our questions
with the utmost cordiality and appreciation of our
point of view, and always there was the feeling of the
entire understanding and fellowship between father
and daughter.</p>

<p>‘She was a keen croquet player, and tolerated
no frivolity when a stroke either at croquet or golf
were in the balance. She was fond of long walks with
Mr. Inglis, and then by herself, and time never hung on
her hands in holiday time, she was always serene and
happy.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was decided that Elsie should go to school in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Paris in September 1882&mdash;a decision not lightly
made; and Mr. Inglis writes after her departure:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I do not think I could have borne to part with you,
my darling, did I not feel the assurance that in doing
so we are following the Lord’s guidance. Your dear
mother and I both made it the subject of earnest prayer,
and I feel we have been guided to do what was best for
you; and we shall see this when the weary time is
over, and we have got you back again with us.</p>

<p>‘When I return to Edinburgh, I feel that I shall
have no one to find out my Psalms for me, or to cut
my <cite>Spectator</cite>, that we shall have no more discussions
regarding the essays of Mr. Fraser, and no more
anxieties about the forthcoming number of the <cite>Edina</cite>.
The nine months will pass quickly.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Elsie’s letters from Paris have not been preserved,
but the ones from her father show the
alert intelligence and interest in all she was reporting.
Of the events at home and abroad, Mr.
Inglis writes to her of the Suez Canal, the bringing
to justice of the Phœnix Park murderers, the great
snowstorm at home, and the Channel Tunnel.
Mrs. Inglis writes with maternal scepticism on
some passing events: ‘I cannot imagine you
making the body of your dress. I think there
would not be many carnivals if you had to make
the dresses yourselves.’ Mr. Inglis, equally sceptical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
has a more satisfactory solution for dressmaking.
‘I hope you have more than one dinner
frock, two or three, and let them be pretty ones.’
Mrs. Inglis, commenting on Elsie’s description of
Gambetta’s funeral, says: ‘He is a loss to France.
Poor France, she always seems to me like a vessel
without a helm driven about just where the winds
take it. She has no sound Christian principle to
guide her. So different from our highly favoured
England.’</p>

<p>Mr. Inglis’ letters are full of the courteous consideration
for Elsie and for others which marked
all the way of his life, and made him the man
greatly beloved, in whatever sphere he moved.
<cite>Punch</cite> and the <cite>Spectator</cite> went from him every
week, and he writes: ‘I hope there was nothing
in that number of <cite>Punch</cite> you gave <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Survelle</span> to
study while you were finishing your breakfast to
hurt his feelings as a Frenchman. <cite>Punch</cite> has not
been very complimentary to them of late.’ And
when Elsie’s sense of humour had been moved by
a saying of her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouvernante</span></i>, Mr. Inglis writes,
desirous of a very free correspondence with home,
but&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘I fear if I send your letter to Eva, at school, that
your remark about Miss &mdash;&mdash; proposal to go down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the lower flat of your house, because the Earl of
Anglesea once lived there, may be repeated and ultimately
reach her with exaggerations, as those things
always do, and may cause unpleasant feelings.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There must have been some exhibition of British
independence, and in dealing with it Mr. Inglis
reminds Elsie of a day in India ‘when you went
off for a walk by yourself, and we all thought
you were lost, and all the Thampanies and chaprasies
and everybody were searching for you all
over the hill.’ One later episode was not on a
hillside, and except for <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les demoiselles</span></i> in Paris,
equally harmless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date"><i>‘<abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 1883</i>.</p>

<p>‘I can quite sympathise with you, my darling, in
the annoyance you feel at not having told Miss Brown
of your having walked home part of the way from
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame M&mdash;&mdash;</span> last Wednesday. It would have been
far better if you had told her, as you wished to do,
what had happened. Concealment is always wrong,
and very often turns what was originally only a trifle
into a serious matter. In this case, I don’t suppose
Miss B. could have said much if you had told her,
though she may be seriously angry if it comes to her
knowledge hereafter. If she does hear of it, you had
better tell her that you told me all about it, and that I
advised you, under the circumstances, as you had not
told her at the time, and that as by doing so now you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
could only get the others into trouble, not to say
anything about it; but keep clear of these things for
the future, my darling.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the end came here, in this life, one of her
school-fellows wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Elsie has been and is such a world-wide inspiration
to all who knew her. One more can testify to
the blessedness of her friendship. Ever since the
Paris days of ’83 her strong loving help was ready
in difficult times, and such wonderfully strengthening
comfort in sorrow.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Paris education ended in the summer of
1883, and Miss Brown, who conducted and lived
with the seven girls who went out with her from
England, writes after their departure:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I cannot tell you how much I felt when you all
disappeared, and how sad it was to go back to look at
your deserted places. I cannot at all realise that you
are now all separated, and that we may never meet
again on earth. May we meet often at the throne of
grace, and remember each other there. It is nice to
have a French maid to keep up the conversations, and
if you will read French aloud, even to yourself, it is of
use.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paris was, no doubt, an education in itself, but
the perennial hope of fond parents that languages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and music are in the air of the continent, were
once again disappointed in Elsie. She was timber-tuned
in ear and tongue, and though she would
always say her mind in any vehicle for thought,
the accent and the grammar strayed along truly
British lines. Her eldest niece supplies a note on
her music:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘She was still a schoolgirl when they returned from
Tasmania. At that time she was learning music at
school. I thought her a wonderful performer on the
piano, but afterwards her musical capabilities became a
family joke which no one enjoyed more than herself.
She had two “pieces” which she could play by heart,
of the regular arpeggio drawing-room style, and these
always had to be performed at any family function as
one of the standing entertainments.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Elsie returned from Paris, the days of the schoolgirlhood
left behind. Her character was formed,
and she had the sense of latent powers. She had
not been long at home when her mother died of a
virulent attack of scarlet fever, and Mr. Inglis lost
the lodestar of his loving nature. ‘From that day
Elsie shouldered all father’s burdens, and they two
went on together until his death.’</p>

<p>In her desk, when it was opened, these ‘Resolutions’
were found. They are written in pencil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and belong to the date when she became the stay
and comfort of her father’s remaining years:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I must give up dreaming,&mdash;making stories.</p>

<p>‘I must give up getting cross.</p>

<p>‘I must devote my mind more to the housekeeping.</p>

<p>‘I must be more thorough in everything.</p>

<p>‘I must be truthful.</p>

<p>‘The bottom of the whole evil is the habit of dreaming,
which must be given up. So help me, God.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">‘I remember</span> well the day Elsie came in and,
sitting down beside father, divulged her plan of
“going in for medicine.” I still see and hear him,
taking it all so perfectly calmly and naturally, and
setting to work at once to overcome the difficulties
which were in the way, for even then all was not
plain sailing for the woman who desired to study
medicine.’ So writes Mrs. M‘Laren, looking back
on the days when the future doctor recognised her
vocation and ministry. If it had been a profession
of ‘plain sailing,’ the adventurous spirit would
probably not have embarked in that particular
vessel. The seas had only just been charted, and
not every shoal had been marked. In the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of them Elsie’s bark was to have its hairbreadth
escapes. The University Commission decided that
women should not be excluded any longer from
receiving degrees owing to their sex. The writer
recollects the description given of the discussion
by the late Sir Arthur Mitchell, K.C.B., one of the
most enlightened minds of the age in which he
lived and achieved so much. He, and one or more
of his colleagues, presented the Commissioners with
the following problem: ‘Why not? On what
theory or doctrine was it just or beneficent to
exclude women from University degrees?’ There
came no answer, for logic cannot be altogether
ignored by a University Commission, so, without
opposition or blare of trumpets, the Scottish
Universities opened their degrees to all students.
It was of good omen that the Commission sat in
high Dunedin, under that rock bastion where
Margaret, saint and queen, was the most learned
member of the Scottish nation in the age in which
she reigned.</p>

<p>Dr. Jex Blake had founded the Edinburgh
School of Medicine for Women, and it was there
that Elsie received her first medical teaching.
Everything was still in its initial stages, and every
step in the higher education of women had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fought and won, against the forces of obscurantism
and professional jealousy.</p>

<p>University Commissions might issue reports, but
the working out of them was left in the hands of
men who were determined to exclude women from
the medical profession.</p>

<p>Clinical teaching could only be carried on in a
few hospitals. Anatomy was learnt under the
most discouraging circumstances. Mixed classes
were, and still are, refused. Extra-mural teaching
became complicated, on the one hand, by the extra
fees which were wrung from women students, and
by the careless and perfunctory teaching accorded
by the twice-paid profession. Professors gave the
off-scourings of their minds, the least valuable of
their subjects, and their unpunctual attendance to
all that stood for female students. It will hardly
be believed that the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh
refused to admit women to clinical teaching in
the wards, until they had raised seven hundred
pounds to furnish two wards in which, and in
which alone, they might work. To these two
wards, with their selected cases, they are still
confined, with the exception of one or two other
less important subjects. Medicals rarely belong
to the moneyed classes, and very few women can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
command the money demanded of the medical
course, and that women should have raised at once
the tax thus put upon them by the Royal Infirmary
is an illustration of how keenly and bravely they
fought through all the disabilities laid upon them.</p>

<p>Women had always staunch friends among the
doctors. The names of many of them are written
in gold in the story of the opening of the profession
to women. It has been observed that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul
had the note of all great minds, a passion to share
his knowledge of a great salvation, with both Jews
and Gentiles. That test of greatness was not conspicuous
in the majority of the medical profession
at the time when Elsie Inglis came as a learner
to the gates of medical science. That kingdom,
like most others, had to suffer violence ere she was
to be known as the good physician in her native
city and in those of the allied nations.</p>

<p>There are no letters extant from Elsie concerning
her time with Dr. Jex Blake. After Mrs.
Inglis’ death, Mr. Inglis decided to leave their
home at Bruntsfield, and the family moved to
rooms in Melville Street. Here Elsie was with her
father, and carried on her studies from his house.
It was not an altogether happy start, and very
soon she had occasion to differ profoundly with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Dr. Jex Blake in her management of the school.
Two of the students failed to observe the discipline
imposed by Dr. Jex Blake, and she expelled them
from the school. Any high-handed act of injustice
always roused Elsie to keen and concentrated
resistance. A lawsuit was brought against Dr.
Jex Blake, and it was successful, proving in its
course that the treatment of the students had been
without justification.</p>

<p>Looking back on this period of the difficult task
of opening the higher education to women, it is
easy to see the defects of many of those engaged
in the struggle. The attitude towards women was
so intolerably unjust that many of the pioneers
became embittered in soul, and had in their bearing
to friends or opponents an air which was often
provocative of misunderstanding. They did not
always receive from the younger generation for
whom they had fought that forbearance that
must be always extended to ‘the old guard,’
whose scars and defects are but the blemishes of
a hardly-contested battle. Success often makes
people autocratic, and those who benefit from the
success, and suffer under the overbearing spirit
engendered, forget their great gains in the galling
sensation of being ridden over rough-shod. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
an episode on which it is now unnecessary to
dwell, and Dr. Inglis would always have been the
first to render homage to the great pioneer work
of Dr. Jex Blake.</p>

<p>Through it all Elsie was living in the presence
chamber of her father’s chivalrous, high-minded
outlook. Whatever action she took then, must have
had his approval, and it was from him that she
received that keen sense of equal justice for all.</p>

<p>These student years threw them more than ever
together. On Sundays they worshipped in the
morning in Free <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Church, and in the
evening in the Episcopal Cathedral. Mr. Inglis
was a great walker, and Elsie said, ‘I learnt to
walk when I used to take those long walks with
father, after mother died.’ Then she would explain
how you <em>should</em> walk. ‘Your whole body should
go into it, and not just your feet.’</p>

<p>Of these student days her niece, Evelyn Simson,
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘When she was about eighteen she began to wear a
bonnet on Sunday. She was the last <em>girl</em> in our connection
to wear one. My Aunt Eva who is two years
younger never did, so I think the fashion must have
changed just then. I remember thinking how very
grown up she must be.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Another niece writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘At the time when it became the fashion for girls to
wear their hair short, when she went out one day, and
came home with a closely-cropped head, I bitterly
resented the loss of Aunt Elsie’s beautiful shining fair
hair, which had been a real glory to her face. She
herself was most delighted with the new style, especially
with the saving of trouble in hairdressing.</p>

<p>‘She only allowed her hair to grow long again
because she thought it was better for a woman doctor
to dress well and as becomingly as possible. This
opinion only grew as she became older, and had been
longer in the profession; in her student days she
rather prided herself on not caring about personal
appearance, and she dressed very badly.</p>

<p>‘Her sense of fairplay was very strong. Once in
college there was an opposition aroused to the Student
Christian Union, and a report was spread that the
students belonging to it were neglecting their college
work. It happened to be the time for the class examinations,
and the lists were posted on the College
notice-board. The next morning, the initials C.U.
were found printed opposite the names of all the
students who belonged to the Christian Union, and,
as these happened to head the list in most instances, the
unfair report was effectually silenced. No one knew
who had initialed the list; it was some time afterwards
I discovered it had been Aunt Elsie.</p>

<p>‘She was a beautiful needlewoman. She embroidered
and made entirely herself two lovely little flannel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
garments for her first grand-nephew, in the midst
of her busy life, then filled to overflowing with the
work of her growing practice, and of her suffrage
activities.</p>

<p>‘The babies as they arrived in the families met with
her special love. In her short summer holidays with
any of us, the children were her great delight.</p>

<p>‘She was a great believer in an open-air life. One
summer she took three of us a short walking tour from
Callander, and we did enjoy it. We tramped over the
hills, and finally arrived at Crianlarich, only to find the
hotel crammed and no sleeping accommodation. She
would take no refusal, and persuaded the manager to
let us sleep on mattresses in the drawing-room, which
added to the adventures of our trip.</p>

<p>‘On the way she entertained us with tales of her
college life, and imbued us with our first enthusiasm
for the women’s cause.</p>

<p>‘When I myself began to study medicine, no one
could have been more enthusiastically encouraging, and
even through the stormy and somewhat depressing
times of the early career of the Medical College for
Women, Edinburgh, her faith and vision never faltered,
and she helped us all to hold on courageously.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1891 Elsie went to Glasgow to take the
examination for the Triple Qualification at the
Medical School there. She could not then take
surgery in Edinburgh, and the facilities for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
clinical teaching were all more favourable in
Glasgow.</p>

<p>It was probably better for her to be away from
all the difficulties connected with the opening of
the second School of Medicine for Women in Edinburgh.
The one founded by Dr. Jex Blake was
the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women, and
the one promoted by Elsie Inglis and other women
students was known as the Medical College for
Women. ‘It was with the fortunes of this school
that she was more closely associated,’ writes Dr.
Beatrice Russell.</p>

<p>In Glasgow she resided at the Y.W.C.A. Hostel.
Her father did not wish her to live alone in lodgings,
and she accommodated herself very willingly to
the conditions under which she had to live. Miss
Grant, the superintendent, became her warm friend.
Elsie’s absence from home enabled her to give a
vivid picture of her life in her daily letters to her
father.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date">
‘<span class="smcap">Glasgow</span>, <i><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 4, 1891</i>.
</p>

<p>‘It was not nice seeing you go off and being left all
alone. After I have finished this letter I am going to
set to work. It seems there are twelve or fourteen
girls boarding here, and there are regular rules. Miss
Grant told me if I did not like some of them to speak
to her, but I am not going to be such a goose as that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
One rule is you are to make your own bed, which she
did not think I could do! But I said I could make it
beautifully. I would much rather do what all the
others do. Well, I arranged my room, and it is as neat
as a new pin. Then we walked up to the hospital,
to the dispensary; we were there till 4.30, as there were
thirty-six patients, and thirty-one of them new.</p>

<p>‘I am most comfortable here, and I am going to
work like <em>anything</em>. I told Miss Barclay so, and she
said, “Oh goodness, we shall all have to look out for our
laurels!”’</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date">
‘<i><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 7, ’91.</i>
</p>

<p>‘Mary Sinclair says it is no good going to the dispensaries
on Saturday, as there are no students there,
and the doctors don’t take the trouble to teach. I
went to Dr. MacEwan’s wards this morning. I was the
first there, so he let me help him with an operation;
then I went over to Dr. Anderson’s.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date">
‘<i><abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 9.</i>
</p>

<p>‘This morning I spent the whole time in Dr. MacEwan’s
wards. He put me through my facings. I could not
think what he meant, he asked me so many questions.
It seems it is his way of greeting a new student. Some
of them cannot bear him, but I think he is really nice,
though he can be abominably sarcastic, and he is a
first-rate surgeon and capital teacher.</p>

<p>‘To-day, it was the medical jurists and the police
officers he was down on, and he told story after story
of how they work by red tape, according to the text-books.
He said that, while he was casualty surgeon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
one police officer said to him that it was no good having
him there, for he never would try to make the medical
evidence fit in with the evidence they had collected.
Once they brought in a woman stabbed in her wrist,
and said they had caught the man who had done it
running away, and he had a knife. Dr. MacEwan said
the cut had been done by glass and not by a knife, so
they could not convict the man, and there was an
awful row over it. Some of them went down to the
alley where it had happened, and sure enough there
was a pane of glass smashed right through the centre.
When the woman knew she was found out, she confessed
she had done it herself. The moral he impressed
on us was to examine your patient before you hear the
story.</p>

<p>‘A. is beginning to get headaches and not sleep at
night. I am thankful to say that is not one of my
tricks. Miss G. is getting unhappy about her, and is
going to send up beef-tea every evening. She offered
me some, but I like my glass of milk much better. I
am taking my tonic and my tramp regularly, so I ought
to keep well. I am quite disgusted when girls break
down through working too hard. They must remember
they are not as strong as men, and then they do idiotic
things, such as taking no exercise, into the bargain.</p>

<p>‘Dr. MacEwan asked us to-day to get the first stray
<abbr title="20,000 pounds">£20,000</abbr> we could for him, as he wants to build a
proper private hospital. So I said he should have the
second <abbr title="20,000 pounds">£20,000</abbr> I came across, as I wanted the first
to build and endow a woman’s College in Edinburgh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
He said he thought that would be great waste; there
should not be separate colleges. “If women are going
to be doctors, equal with the men, they should go to the
same school.” I said I quite agreed with him, but
when they won’t admit you, what are you to do?
“Leave them alone,” he said; “they will admit you
in time,” and he thought outside colleges would only
delay that.</p>

<p>‘This morning in Dr. MacEwan’s wards a very curious
case came in. Some of us tried to draw it, never
thinking he would see us, and suddenly he swooped
round and insisted on seeing every one of the scribbles.
He has eyes, I believe, in the back of his head and ears
everywhere. He forgot, I thought, to have the ligature
taken off a leg he was operating on, and I said so in
the lowest whisper to M.&nbsp;S. About five minutes afterwards,
he calmly looked straight over to us, and said,
“<em>Now</em>, we’ll take off the ligature!”</p>

<p>‘I went round this morning and saw a few of my
patients. I found one woman up who ought to have
been in bed. I discovered she had been up all night
because her husband came in tipsy about eleven
o’clock. He was lying there asleep on the bed. I
think he ought to have been horse-whipped, and when
I have the vote I shall vote that all men who turn
their wives and families out of doors at eleven o’clock
at night, especially when the wife is ill, shall be horse-whipped.
And, if they make the excuse that they were
tipsy, I should give them double. They would very
soon learn to behave themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>‘As to the father of the cherubs you ask about, his
family does not seem to lie very heavily on his mind.
He is not in work just now, and apparently is very
often out of work. One cannot take things seriously
in that house.</p>

<p>‘In the house over the Clyde I saw the funniest
sight. It is an Irish house, as dirty as a pig-sty, and
there are about ten children. When I got there, at
least six of the children were in the room, and half of
them without a particle of clothing. They were sitting
about on the table and on the floor like little cherubs
with black faces. I burst out laughing when I saw
them, and they all joined in most heartily, including
the mother, though not one of them saw the joke, for
they came and stood just as they were round me in a
ring to see the baby washed. Suddenly, the cherubs
began to disappear and ragged children to appear
instead. I looked round to see who was dressing them,
but there was no one there. They just slipped on their
little black frocks, without a thing on underneath, and
departed to the street as soon as the baby was washed.</p>

<p>‘Three women with broken legs have come in. I
don’t believe so many women have ever broken their
legs together in one day before! One of them is a shirt
finisher. She sews on the buttons and puts in the gores
at the rate of <abbr title="4 pence ha’penney">4½d.</abbr> a dozen shirts. We know the shop,
and they <em>sell</em> the shirts at <abbr title="4 shillings and 6 pence">4s. 6d.</abbr> each. Of course,
political economy is quite true, but I hope that shopkeeper,
if ever he comes back to this earth, will be a
woman and have to finish shirts at <abbr title="4 pence ha’penney">4½d.</abbr> a dozen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
then he’ll see the other side of the question. I told
the woman it was her own fault for taking such small
wages, at which she seemed amused. It is funny the
stimulating effect a big school has on a hospital. The
Royal here is nearly as big and quite as rich as the
Edinburgh Royal, but there is no pretence that they
really are in their teaching and arrangements the
third hospital in the kingdom, as they are in size.
<em>The</em> London Hospital is the biggest, and then comes
Edinburgh, and this is the third. Guy’s and Bart.’s,
that one hears so much about, are quite small in comparison,
but they have big medical schools attached.
The doctors seem to lie on their oars if they don’t
have to teach.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In Glasgow the women students had to encounter
the opposition to ‘mixed classes,’ and the
fight centred in the Infirmary. It would have been
more honest to have promulgated the decision of
the Managers before the women students had paid
their fees for the full course of medical tuition.</p>

<p>Elsie, in her letters, describes the toughly fought
contest, and the final victory won by the help of
the just and enlightened leaders in the medical
world. ‘So here is another fight,’ writes the
student, with a sigh of only a half regret! It was
too good a fight, and the backers were too strong
for the women students not to win their undoubted
rights. Through all the chaffing and laughter, one
perceives the thread of a resolute purpose, and
Elsie’s great gift, the unconquerable facing of
‘the Hill Difficulty.’ True, the baffled and puzzled
enemy often played into their hands, as when
Dr. T., driven to extremity in a weak moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
threatened to prevent their attendance by ‘physical
force.’ The threat armed the students with yet
another legal grievance. Elsie describes on one
occasion in her haste going into a ward where
Dr. Gemmel, one of the ‘mixed’ objectors, was
demonstrating. She perceived her mistake, and
retreated, not before receiving a smile from her
enemy. The now Sir William MacEwan enjoyed
the fight quite as much as his women students;
and if to-day he notes the achievements of the
Scottish Women’s Hospitals, he may count as his
own some of their success in the profession in which
he has achieved so worthy a name. The dispute
went on until at length an exhausted foe laid down
its weapons, and the redoubtable Dr. T. conveyed
the intimation that the women students might go
to any of the classes&mdash;and a benison on them!</p>

<p>The faction fight, like many another in the
brave days of old, roared and clattered down the
paved causeways of Glasgow. Dr. T., in his gate-house,
must have wished his petticoat foes many
times away and above the pass. If he, or any of
the obstructionists of that day survive, we know
that they belong to a sect that needs no repentance.
They may, however, note with self-complacency
that their action trained on a generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
skilled in the contest of fighting for democratic
rights in the realm of knowledge. It is a birthright
to enter into that gateway, and the keys are given
to all who possess the understanding mind and
reverent attitude towards all truth.</p>

<p>‘Those old wretches, the Infirmary Managers, have
reared their heads again, and now have decided that
we are not to go to mixed classes, and we have been
tearing all over the wards seeing all sorts of people
about it. I went to Dr. K.’s this morning&mdash;all right.
Crossing the quadrangle, a porter rushed at me and
said, “Dr. T. wants to see all the lady students at the
gate-house.” I remarked to Miss M., “I am certainly
not going to trot after Dr. T. for casual messages like
that. He can put up a notice if he wants me.” We
were going upstairs to Dr. R. when another porter
ran up and said, “Dr. T. is in his office. He would
be much obliged if you would speak to him.” So we
laughed, and said that was more polite anyhow, and
went into the office. So he hummed and hawed,
looked everywhere except at us, and then said the
Infirmary Managers said we were not to go to mixed
classes. So I promptly said, “Then I shall come for
my fees to-morrow,” and walked out of the room. I
was angry. I went straight back to Dr. K., who said he
was awfuly sorry and angry, and he would see Dr. T.,
but he was afraid he could do nothing.</p>

saying there was a radical change in the country, and
that no one was taking any notice of it, and no one
knew where it was to land us. This was the draft

the education of women on the same footing as that
of men, and, worse still, seemed to countenance mixed
classes. The <cite>G.&nbsp;H.</cite> seems to think this is the beginning
of the end, and will necessarily lead to woman’s
suffrage, and it will probably land them in the pulpit;

may compete for any of the bursaries, and many
bursaries can only be held on condition that the holder
means to enter the Church! You never read such an
article, and it was not the least a joke but sober earnest.</p>

I tried to get that prize was to pay for those things and
not worry you about them. I want to pass awfully
well, as it tells all one’s life through, and I <em>mean</em> to
be very successful!</p>

<p>‘Dr. B. has the most absurd way of agreeing with

with a finger. I thought it was past all mending and
said, “Amputate it.” “Quite so, quite so,” he said
solemnly, “but we’ll dress it to-day with such and such
a thing.” There were two or three other cases in which
I recommended desperate measures, in which he agreed,
but did not follow. Finally, he asked Mr. B. what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
would do with a swelling. Mr. B. hesitated. I said,
“Open it.” Whereupon he went off into fits of laughter,

<p>The remaining letters are filled with all the hopes
and fears of the examined. Mr. MacEwan tells her
she will pass ‘with one hand,’ and Elsie has the
usual moan over a defective memory, and the
certainties that she will be asked all the questions
to which she has no answering key. The evidences
of hard and conscientious study abound, and, after
she had counted the days and rejoined her father,
she found she had passed through the heavy ordeal
with great success, and, having thus qualified, could
pass on to yet unconquered realms of experience
and service.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">After</span> completing her clinical work in Glasgow,
and passing the examination for the Triple Qualification
in 1892, it was decided that Elsie should
go to London and work as house-surgeon in the
new Hospital for Women in the Euston Road. In
1916 that hospital kept its jubilee year, and when
Elsie went to work there it had been established
for nearly thirty years. Its story contains the
record of the leading names among women doctors.
In the commemorative prayer of Bishop Paget,
an especial thanksgiving was made ‘for the good
example of those now at rest, Elizabeth Blackwell,
and Sophia Jex Blake, of good work done by
women doctors throughout the whole world, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
now especially of the high trust and great responsibility
committed to women doctors in this hour
of need.’ The hearts of many present went over
the washing seas, to the lands wasted by fire and
sword, and to the leader of the Scottish Women’s
Hospitals, who had gained her earliest surgical
experience in the wards of the first hospital founded
by the first woman doctor, and standing for the new
principle that women can practise the healing art.</p>

<p>Elsie Inglis took up her work with keen energy
and a happy power of combining work with varied
interests. In the active months of her residence
she resolutely ‘tramped’ London, attended most
of the outstanding churches, and was a great
sermon taster of ministers ranging from Boyd
Carpenter to Father Maturin. Innumerable relatives
and friends tempted her to lawn tennis and
the theatres. She had a keen eye to all the
humours of the staff, and formed her own opinions
on patients and doctors with her usual independence
of judgment.</p>

<p>Elsie’s letters to her father were detailed and
written daily. Only a very small selection can be
quoted, but every one of them is instinct with a
buoyant outlook, and they are full of the joy of
service.</p>

<p>It is interesting to read in these letters her
descriptions of the work of Dr. Garrett Anderson,
and then to read Dr. Louisa Garrett Anderson’s
speech on her mother at the jubilee of the hospital.
‘I shall never forget her at Victoria Station on the
day when the Women’s Hospital Corps was leaving
England for France, early in September 1914. She
was quite an old woman, her life’s work done,
but the light of battle was in her eyes, and she
said, “Had I been twenty years younger I would
have been taking you myself.” Just twenty-one
years before the war broke down the last of the
barriers against women’s work as doctors, Elsie
Inglis entered the New Hospital for Women, to
learn with that staff of women doctors who had
achieved so much under conditions so full of
difficulties and discouragements.</p>

‘<span class="smcap">New Hospital for Women</span>,<br />
<span class="in_a_bit1">‘<span class="smcap">Euston Rd.</span>, 1892&ndash;3.</span>
</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My own dearest Papa</span>,&mdash;Here we begin another
long series of letters. The people in the carriage were
very quiet, so I slept all right. Of course they shut
up all the windows, so I opened all the ventilators, and
I also opened the window two or three times. I had
breakfast at once, and then a bath, and then came in
for a big operation by Mrs. Boyd. Her husband came
up to help her. Mrs. Scharlieb and Mrs. de la Cherois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
were up too&mdash;both of them visiting doctors. I have been
all round the wards and got a sort of idea of the cases
in my head, but I shall have to get them all up properly.
The visiting physicians seem to call all over the day,
from nine o’clock in the morning till three in the afternoon.
Some of the students from the School of Medicine
are dressers and clerks. I believe I have to drill them,
but of course they are only very senior students,
because their real hospital is the Royal Free. There
are four wards, two of them round, with two fireplaces
back to back in the middle. The other two wards
are oblong, and they are all prettily painted, and
bright. Then there are two small wards for serious
cases. I have not arranged my room yet, as I have
not had a minute. I am going out to post this and
get a stethescope. Mrs. de la Cherois has been here;
she is a nice old lady, and awfully particular. I would
much rather work with people like that than people
who are anyhow. Mrs. Scharlieb is about forty, very
dark and solemn. The nurses seem nice, but they
don’t have any special uniform, which I think is a pity;
so they are pinks and greys and blues, and twenty
different patterns of caps. I think I shall like being
here very much. I only hope I shall get on with all
my mistresses! And, I <em>hope</em> I shall always remember
what to do.</p>

<p>‘The last big operation case died. It was very sad,
and very provoking, for she really was doing well, but
she had not vitality enough to stand the shock. That
was the case whose doctor told her and her husband that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
she was suffering from <em>hysteria</em>. And that man, you
know, can be a fellow of the colleges, and member of
any society he likes to apply to, while Mrs. G. Anderson
and Mrs. Scharlieb cannot! Is it not ridiculous?</p>

<p>‘Mrs. G. Anderson said she was going to speak to
Mrs. M‘Call about my having one of her maternity
posts. I shall come home first, however, my own
dearest Papa. Mrs. G.&nbsp;A. said she thought I should
have a good deal more of that kind of work if I was
going to set up in a lonely place like Edinburgh, as I
ought <em>never</em> to have to call in a man to help me out of
a hole!</p>

<p>‘Mrs. G. Anderson is going to take me to a Cinderella
dance to-night in aid of the hospital. I am to meet her
at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’ Hall. We had an awful morning of it.
Mrs. G.&nbsp;A. is taking Mrs. M.’s ward, and turned up 9.30,
Mrs. S.’s hour. Then Miss C. came in on the top to
consult about two of her cases. Into the bargain, A.
slept late, and did not arrive till near ten, so, by the
time they had all left, I had a lovely medley of treatment
in my head. My fan has arrived, and will come
in for to-night. I hope Mrs. G. Anderson will be a nice
chaperone and introduce one properly. I am to go
early, and her son is to look out for me, and begin the
introducing till she comes. Miss Garrett has been
to-day painting the hall for the Chicago Exhibition.
She is going to the dance to-night. She says Mrs.
Fawcett got some more money out of the English Commissioners
in a lovely way. These Commissioners have
spent <abbr title="17,000 pounds">£17,000</abbr> in building themselves a kiosk in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
ground, and they allowed Mrs. Fawcett <abbr title="500 pounds">£500</abbr> to represent
women’s work in England. Every one is
furious about it. Well, Mrs. Fawcett has managed to
get an extra <abbr title="500 pounds">£500</abbr>. She wrote, and said that if she did
not get any more she could not mount all the photographs
and drawings, but would put up a notice that
“the English Commission was too poor to allow for
mounting and framing.” This, with the kiosk in the
ground!</p>

<p>‘One of the patients here was once upon a time a
servant at the Baroness Burdett Coutts’. She certainly
was most awfully kind to her, sent her <abbr title="10 pounds">£10</abbr> to pay her
rent, and has now paid to send her to the Cottage.
Miss B. is in hopes she may get her interested in the
hospital now, but it seems she does not approve of
women doctors and such things. Perhaps, as the old
housemaid did so well here, she may change her mind.
The Report is out now. I shall send them to some of
the doctors in Edinburgh. I see in it that Mr. Robertson
left <abbr title="1000 pounds">£1000</abbr> in memory of his wife to the hospital, and
that is how that bed comes to be called the “Caroline
Croom Robertson bed.”</p>

<p>‘We had two big operations to-day. We had the
usual round in the morning, and then we had to prepare.
I did one lovely thing! This morning, I pointed out
to Mrs. Scharlieb with indignation that our galvanic
battery had run out. I said that it really was disgraceful
of C., for it had only been used once for a quarter
of an hour since the last time he had charged it. Mrs.
S. agreed, and said she would go in and speak to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and tell him to send her battery, which was with him
being charged. We wanted a battery for the galvanic
cautery. Well, Mrs. Scharlieb’s battery arrived. I
tried it, and found it would not heat the cautery
properly. So I was very angry, and I sat down and
wrote C. a peppery letter. I told him to send some
competent person <em>at once</em> to look at the battery, and
to be prepared to lend us one, if this competent person
saw it was necessary. M. flew off, and in twenty
minutes a man from C. arrived, very humble. I turned
on the batteries, and showed him that they would not
heat up properly. Sister said I talked to him like a
mother. He departed very humbly to bring another
battery. In about half an hour Sister whistled up,
C.’s man would like to see me. Down I went. He
looked at me with a twinkle in his eye. “You had not
taken the resistance off, Miss,” and held one of the
cautery red-hot attached to our own battery. Was
not I sold! I had humbly to apologise. And the
amount of nervous energy I had wasted on that
battery!</p>

<p>‘We began to-day with a big operation. It went
perfectly splendidly. The chloroform was given by a
Dr. B., some special friend of the patient, so, I hoped
there would be no hitch, and there was none. He
had the cheek afterwards to say to Dr. S., that no one
could have done it better! Mrs. S. seemed rather
pleased, but I thought it awfully patronising, was it
not?</p>

<p>‘Did I tell you that Mrs. S. and Miss Walker were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
talking the other morning of the time when they would
make this a qualifying hospital? Miss C. said it would
certainly come some day, and of course, to make it a
qualifying hospital, they must have men’s beds, and
that will mean a mixed staff. However, all that is
in the future. Then, we will show the old-fashioned
hospitals, with their retrograde managers, etc., <em>how</em>
a mixed staff can work. I wonder if they will have
mixed classes too!</p>

<p>‘I enjoyed <cite>King Lear</cite> very much. The scenery was
magnificent. King Lear was not a bit kingly, but just
a weak, old man. I suppose that was what he was
meant to be. Ellen Terry was splendid. The storm
on the heath awful. I shivered in my seat when the
wind whistled. The last scene&mdash;the French camp on
the cliffs on Dover&mdash;was really beautiful.</p>

<p>‘Yesterday, I did a lovely thing&mdash;slept like a top till
almost nine. I suppose I was tired after the exciting
cases. Janet burst into my room with “Mrs. S. will
be here in a very few minutes, Miss.” So, out I
tumbled, and tore downstairs to meet Mrs. S. in the
hall! I tried to look as if I had had breakfast <em>hours</em>
before, and I don’t think she suspected that was my
first appearance. She did her visit, and then I went
to breakfast. As luck would have it, Mrs. G. Anderson
chose that morning of all others to show a friend of
hers round the hospital. She marched calmly into the
board-room to find me grubbing. I saw the only thing
to do was to be quite cool, so I got up and shook hands,
and remarked, “I am rather late this morning,” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
she only laughed. It was about 10.30, a nice time for
an H.S. to be having breakfast.</p>

<p>‘I did not go to hear Father Maturin after all yesterday.
I have been very busy; we have had another
big operation, doing all right so far. She is an artist’s
wife; she has had an unhappy time for four years,
because she has been very ill, and their doctor said
it was hysteria, and told her husband not to give in
to the nonsense. Really, some of these general
practitioners are <em>grand</em>. They send some of the
patients in with the most outrageous diagnoses you
can imagine. One woman was told her life was not
worth a year’s purchase, and she must have a big
operation. So she came in. We pummelled her all
over, and could not find the grounds of his diagnosis,
and finally treated for something quite different, and
she went out well in six weeks. Her doctor came to
see her, and said, “Well, madam, I could not have
believed it.” It is better they should err in that
direction than in the direction of calling real illness
“hysteria.”</p>

<p>‘I mean to have a hospital of my own in Edinburgh
some day.</p>

<p>‘A patient with a well-balanced nervous system
will get well in just half the time that one of these
hysterical women will. There is one plucky little
woman in just now. She has had a bad operation,
but nothing has ever disturbed her equilibrium. She
smiles away in the pluckiest way, and gets well more
quickly than anybody. I agree with Kingsley: one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of the necessities of the world is to teach girls to be
brave, and not whine over everything, and the first step
for that is to teach them to play games!</p>

<p>‘Fancy who has been here this evening&mdash;Bailie
Walcot. He has come up to London on Parliamentary
business. He investigated every hole and corner of
the hospital. He says our girls are going to Dr.
Littlejohn’s class with Jex’s girls at Surgery Hall. It
is wonderful how these men who would do nothing
at first are beginning to see it pays to be neutral now.</p>

<p>‘We have a lot to be grateful to J.&nbsp;B. for; Bailie W.
told me the Leith managers have approached the
Edinburgh managers, saying, “If you will undertake
no more women students, we will undertake to take
both schools, and to build immediately.” Bailie
Walcot said he and Mr. Scott of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s were the
<em>only</em> two who opposed this. If they send us down to
Leith we must make the best of it, and really try to
make it a good school, but it will be a great pity.</p>

<p>‘The dance was awfully nice. Mrs. G. Anderson
is a capital chaperone. I managed to go off without
my ticket, and the damsel at the door was very severe,
and said I must wait till Mrs. Garrett Anderson came.
I waited quietly a minute or two, and was just going
to ask her to send in to see if Mrs. Anderson had come,
then a man marched in, and said in a lovely manner,
“I have forgotten my ticket,” and she merely said,
“You must give me your name, sir,” and let him pass.
After that I gave my name and passed too! I found
I might have waited till doomsday, for Mrs. G.&nbsp;A. was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
inside. I danced every dance; it was a lovely floor
and lovely music, and you may make up your mind,
papa dear, that I go to all the balls in Edinburgh after
this. They had two odd dances called Barn-door. I
thought it would be a kind of Sir Roger, but it was the
oddest kind of hop, skip and dance I ever saw. I said
to Mrs. G.&nbsp;A. it was something like a Schottische, only
not a quarter so pretty. She said it was pretty when
nicely danced, but people have not learnt it yet. I
rashly said to Mrs. G.&nbsp;A. that I could get some tea from
the night nurse when I got home (because I wanted to
dance the extras), but she was horrified at tea just
before going to sleep, and swept me into the refreshment-room
and made me drink soup by the gallon. I
came home with Miss Garrett. We had an operation
this morning, so you see dances don’t interfere with
the serious business of life.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Scharlieb came in here the other day, and
declared I was qualifying for acute bronchitis; but I
told her nobody could have acute bronchitis who had
a cold bath every morning, and had been brought up
to open windows. This is the third sit down to your
letter. Talk of women at home never being able to do
anything without being interrupted every few minutes!
I think you have only to be house surgeon to know
what being interrupted means. They not only knock
and march in at the door, but they also whistle up the
tube&mdash;most frightfully startling it used to be at first,
to hear a sort of shrill fog-horn in the room. There
are three high temperatures, and the results are sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
up to me whenever they are taken. We are sponging
them, and may have to put them into cold baths,
but I hope not. Mrs. G.&nbsp;A. told me to do it without
waiting for the chief, if I thought it necessary, whereupon
Mrs. B. remarked, “I think Miss Inglis ought to
be warned the patient may die.”</p>

<p>‘Lovely weather here. I have been prescribing
sunshine, sunshine, sunshine for all the patients.
There are only two balconies on each floor, and nurse
Rose is reported to have said that she supposed I wanted
the patients hung out over the railings, for otherwise
there would not be room. Miss W. came this morning,
to Sister’s indignation. “Does not she think she can
trust me for one day?” So I said it was only that
she was so delighted at having a ward; and that I was
sure I would do the same. “Oh,” said Sister, “I
am thankful you have not a ward. You would bring
a box with sandwiches and sit there all day.” I am
always having former H.S.’s thrown at my head who
came round exactly to the minute, twice a day, whereas
they say I am never out of the wards, at least they
never know when I am coming. I tell them I don’t
want them to trot round after me with an ink-bottle.
Miss R. says I have no idea of discipline! I make
one grand round a day, with the ink-bottle, and then
I don’t want the nurses to take any more notice of me.
I think that is far more sensible than having fixed
times. I quite agree the ink-bottle round ought to
be at a fixed time, but I cannot help other things
turning up to be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I had to toddle off and ask for Mrs. K. She is the
one who is appointed to give anæsthetics in the
hospital. They are all most frightfully nervous about
anæsthetics here, in all the hospitals, and have regular
anæsthetists. In Edinburgh and Glasgow the students
give it, under the house surgeons of course. I never
saw any death, or anything that was very frightening.
One real reason is, I believe, that they watch the wrong
organ, viz. the heart. In Scotland they hardly think
of the heart, and simply watch the breathing. The
Hydrabad Commission settled conclusively that it was
the breathing gave out first; but having made up their
minds that it does not, all the Commissions in the world
won’t convince them to the contrary. In the meantime
they do their operations in fear and trembling, continually
asking if the patient is all right.</p>

<p>‘You never saw such a splendid out-patient department
as they have here&mdash;a perfectly lovely, comfortable
waiting-room, and pretty receiving waiting-room.
The patients have to pay a small sum, yet they had
over 20,000 visits this year up to November&mdash;that is
about half the size of the Glasgow Royal, one of the
biggest out-patients in the kingdom, and general. This
is paying, and for women! Who says women doctors
are not wanted!</p>

<p>‘This morning I started off, meaning to go to Dr.
Vaughan in the Temple Church. Sister C. told me I
ought to be early, and of course I was as late as I could
be. As I was running downstairs Nurse Helen asked
me if I had ever heard Stopford Brooke. I had heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
his name, but I could not remember anything about
him. Nurse H. said he was an awful heretic, and had
got into trouble for his opinions. As a general rule
men who get into trouble for their opinions are worth
listening to&mdash;at least they <em>have</em> opinions. So I left
Dr. Vaughan, and went off to Mr. S. Brooke. He gave
a capital sermon with nothing heterodox in it, about
loving our fellow-men. I liked him, and would
go to-night to hear his lecture on “In Memoriam,”
but Sister C. is going out.</p>

<p>‘You know you must not aim at a separate but at a
mixed school in Edinburgh. I am sure this is best, and
all the women here think so too. I wonder when the
University means to succumb.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. G. Anderson asked me to come and help her
with a small operation in an hotel. She gave me a
half-guinea fee for so doing. We drove there in a
hansom, and drove back in her carriage. She was
most jovial and talkative. We went into the Deanery,
Westminster Abbey, on our way back to leave cards on
somebody. You suddenly seem to get out of the noise
and rush of London when you turn in there. It is
quite quiet and green. All sorts of men were wandering
about in red gowns and black gowns. We were told
it was Convocation.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Scharlieb was awfully nice and kind. She said
she hoped I would get on always as well as I had here.
Was not it nice of her? I said I hoped I would do
much better, for I thought I had made an awful lot of
mistakes since I came here. She says everybody has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to make mistakes. The worst of being a doctor is that
one’s mistakes matter so much. In everything else
you just throw away what you have messed and begin
again, but you cannot do that as a doctor.</p>

<p>‘She said she expects to be called in as my consultant
when I am a surgeon. Won’t my patients have to pay
fees to get her up from London!</p>

<p>‘Miss C. has been trying to get on to some of the
medical societies, and has failed. I shall not demean
myself by asking to get on&mdash;shall wait till they beseech
the honour of adding my name.</p>

<p>‘As to women doctors here having an assured
position, I rather like the pioneer work, I think! I
mean to make friends with all the nice doctors, and
vanquish all the horrid selfish ones, and end by being a
Missionary Professor.</p>

<p>‘If I don’t get into the Infirmary in Edinburgh, I
mean to build a hospital for myself, like this one.
Indeed I don’t know that I should not like the hospital
to myself better! I’ll build it where the Cattle Market
is, at the head of Lady Lawson Street. That would
be convenient for all the women in Fountainbridge, and
the Grassmarket and Cowgate, and it would be comparatively
high. To begin with, I mean to rent Eva’s
hall from her for a dispensary. You see it is all
arranged!’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next course Elsie decided on taking was one
of three months in Midwifery in the Rotunda,
Dublin. There was a greater equality of teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
there in mixed classes, and also she thought the
position of the whole hospital staff was on lines
which would enable her to gain the most experience
in this branch, where she ultimately achieved
so much for her fellow-citizens in Edinburgh.</p>

</p>

<p>‘I went over to the Rotunda and saw Dr. Glenn,
the assistant master. I am “clerk” on Mondays and
Thursdays. The only other person here is a native
from the Nizam’s Dominions. At breakfast this morning
he told me about his children, who are quite fair
“like their mother.” How fond he was of London,
and how he would not live in India now for anything;
he finds the climate enervating! I told him I thought
India a first-rate place to live in, and that I should like
to go back.</p>

<p>‘By the way, fancy the franchise for the Parish
Councils being carried. The first thing I saw when
I landed was defeat of the Government! The <cite>Independent</cite>
here is jubilant, partly because the point
of woman’s suffrage is carried, partly because the
Government is beaten.</p>

<p>‘So the strike has ended, and the men go back to
work on their old wages till February. I expect both
sides are sick of it, but I am glad the men have carried
it so far. Lord Rosebery is a clever man.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. C. evidently thinks I am quite mad, for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
have asked for a cold bath in my room. “Good
gracious me, miss! it’s not cold entoirely ye’ll be
meaning.”</p>

<p>‘I went to see the D.’s. The first thing I was told
was that a Miss D. sat in their church, an M.B. of the
Royal Infirmary. A very clever girl, she has just taken
a travelling bursary and is going to Vienna. “But
we don’t know her, they are Home Rulers!” Mrs. D.
went on to say both she and her father were Home
Rulers, but that she for one would not mind if they did
not obtrude their politics. So, I thought, “Well, I
won’t obtrude mine.” Then Mrs. D. said, “You must
take a side, you know, and say distinctly what side you
are on when you are asked.” So I thought, “Well,
I’ll wait till I am asked,” and I have got through to-day
without being asked. But, positively, they used the
word “boycott” about those D.’s. They have been
boycotted by the congregation. It must be rather
hard to be a Home Ruler and a Presbyterian just now
in Ireland. Positively, they frightened me so, I nearly
squirmed under the table. However, when I looked
round the congregation I thought I should not mind
much being boycotted by them. The sermon was one
about forgiving your enemies. Mrs. D. has given me
a standing invitation to come to dinner on Sunday.
What will happen when I am suddenly asked to take
my side, I don’t know. In the meantime I will let
things slide! Mrs. D. asked me if the Costigans were
Catholics, and said she thought Mrs. C. looked so nice
she could not be one.’</p>

‘<i><abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 1893.</i>
</p>

<p>‘I have done nothing but race after cases to-day.
One old woman was killing. She came for Dr. B.,
whom she said she had known before he was born. Dr.
B. could not go, so I went. “Hech,” she said, “I
came for a <em>doctor</em>.” “Well, I’m the doctor. Come
along.” “Deed no,” she said; “ye’re no a doctor&mdash;ye’re
just a wumman.” I did laugh, and marched her
off. She was grandly tipsy when I left the home, so
I am going back to see how the patient has got on, in
spite of the nursing.</p>

<p>‘I had a second polite speech made to me last night.
I was introduced into a house by the person who came
for me as the doctor. When I had been in about two
minutes, a small man of four years old, said suddenly in
a clear voice “That is <em>not</em> a doctor, it’s a girl!” I told
him he was behind the age not to know that one could
be both.</p>

<p>‘We had a chloroform scare this morning. I admired
Dr. S.’s coolness immensely. He finished tying his
stitches quietly while two doctors were skipping round
like a pair of frightened girls. It ended all right. They
don’t know how to give chloroform anywhere out of
Scotland. It is very odd.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. D. declared she was going to write to you that
she had found I had gone out without my breakfast.
So, here are the <em>facts</em>! I was out last night, and was
not up when they rang over for me. So, before having
my breakfast I just ran over to see what they wanted
me for, and finding it would keep I came back for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
breakfast to find Mrs. D. here. I am not such an idiot
as to miss my meals, Papa, dearest. My temper won’t
stand it! I always have a glass of milk and a biscuit
when I go out at night. I am as sensible as I can be.
I know you cannot do work with blunt instruments,
and this instrument blunts very easily without food
and exercise.</p>

one stays six months they examine one, and give a

<p>‘I got your letter at eleven when I came down to
breakfast. I shall never get into regular order for
home again. No one blames one for lying in bed here
or being late, for no one knows how late you have
been up the night before, or how many cases you have
been at before you get to the lecture. It is partly that,
and partly their casual Irish ways. I have had a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
from Miss MacGregor this morning, asking what I
should say to our starting together in Edinburgh. It
is a thing to be thought about. It is quite true, as
she says, that two women are much more comfortable
working together. They can give chloroform for one
another and so on, and consult together. On the
other hand, we could do that just as well if we simply
started separately, and were friends.</p>

<p>‘Miss MacGregor was one of the J.-B. lot, and she
and I had awful rows over that question. But we
certainly got on very well before that, and, as she says,
that was not a personal question. I am quite sure
Miss MacGregor is Scotch enough not to propose any
arrangement which won’t be to her own advantage.
Probably, I know a good many more people than she
does. The question for me is whether it will be for
my advantage. I am rather inclined to think it will.
Miss MacGregor is a splendid pathologist. Nowadays
one ought to do a lot of that work with one’s cases, and
I have been puzzling over how one could, and yet keep
aseptic. If we could make some arrangement by
which we could work into one another’s hands in that
way, I think it would be for both our advantages.
There is one thing in favour of it, if Miss MacGregor
and I are definitely working together, no one can be
astonished at our not calling in other people. Miss
MacGregor, apart from everything else, is distinctly one
of our best women, and it would be nice working
with her. What do you think of it, Papa, dear? Of
course I should live at home in any case. My consulting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>

<p>This was nearly the last letter written by Elsie
to her father. In most of her letters during the
preceding months it was obvious Mr. Inglis’ health
was causing her anxiety, and the inquiries and
suggestions for his well-being grew more urgent
as the shadow of death fell increasingly dark on
the written pages.</p>

<p>Elsie returned to receive his eager welcome, but
even her eyes were blinded to the rapidly approaching
parting. On the 15th of March 1894, she wrote
to her brother Ernest in India, telling all the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of Mr. Inglis’ passing on the 13th of that month.
There was much suffering borne with quiet patience,
‘He never once complained: I never saw such a
patient.’ At the end, he turned towards the
window, and then a bright look came into his eyes.
He said, ‘Pull down the blind.’ Then the chivalrous,
knightly soul passed into the light that never
was on sea or land.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘It was a splendid life he led,’ writes Elsie to her
brother; ‘his old Indian friends write now and say how
“the name of John Inglis always represented everything
that was upright and straightforward and high principled
in the character of a Christian gentleman.” He always
said that he did not believe that death was the stopping
place, but that one would go on growing and learning
through all eternity. God bless him in his onward
journey. I simply cannot imagine life without him. We
had made such plans, and now it does not seem worth
while to go on working at all. I wish he could have
seen me begin. He was so pleased about my beginning.
I said it would be such a joke to see Dr. Elsie Inglis up.
Saturday afternoons were to be his, and he was to come
over in my trap.</p>

<p>‘He never thought of himself at all. Even when he
was very ill at the end, he always looked up when one
went in, and said, “Well, my darling.” I am glad I
knew about nursing, for we did not need to have any
stranger about him. He would have hated that.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot express the deep interest, or the ardent
hopes with which my bosom is filled on the occasion, or
the earnest though humble prayer to the Giver of all
good which it has uttered that He may shed abundantly
upon you <em>both</em> the rich mercies of His grace: with those
feelings I take each of you to my heart, and give you
my parental love and blessing. You have told me
enough of the object of your fond choice to make her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
henceforth dear to me, to all of us, on her own account,
as well as yours.</p>

<p>‘And here, my beloved David, I would turn for a
moment more immediately to yourself, as being now
in a situation very different from that in which you
have hitherto been placed. As a husband, then, it
will now behove you to remember that you are not
your own exclusive property&mdash;that for a single moment
you must never forget; the tender love and affectionate
respect and consideration which are due from you to
the amiable individual who has bestowed on you her
hand and heart, it will, I assure myself, be your
pleasing duty to prove, by unceasing attention to, and
solicitude for, her every wish how dearly you appreciate
her worth, as well as <em>gift</em>; and that her future comfort
and happiness will invariably possess an estimation
in your view paramount to every feeling that can more
immediately or personally affect yourself. Let such
be manifest in your every act, as connected with every
object in which <em>she</em> is concerned. Her love and
affection for you will then be reciprocal and pure and
lasting, and thus will you become to each other what,
under God’s blessing, you are meant to be&mdash;a mutual
comfort and an abiding stay. Make her the confidential
friend of your bosom, to whom its every thought
must unreservedly be imparted&mdash;the soother of all its
cares, its anxieties, and disappointments, when they
chance to arise; the fond participator in all your
happiness and joys, from whatever source they may
spring&mdash;you will thus be discharging a duty which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
your sacred obligations at the altar have entailed
upon you.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This letter has been quoted with its phrasing of
seventy years ago, because it shows an advanced
outlook on the position of husband and wife, and
the setting forth of their equality and the respect
paid to their several positions. It may have
influenced Mr. Inglis’ views, both in his perfect
relations with his wife and the sympathetic liberty
of thought and action which he encouraged in his
own family.</p>

<p>This chapter is devoted to the political and
public life of Elsie Inglis. It can be written in a
fortunate hour. The ‘common cause’ to which she
gave so much of her life has now been won. The
tumult and the turmoil are now hushed in peace
and security. The age which began in John
Stuart Mill’s ‘Subjection of Women’ has ended
in the Representation of the People’s Bill. It is
possible to review the political period of the
generation which produced Elsie Inglis, and her
comrades in the struggle against the disqualification
of sex, without raising any fresh controversy.</p>

<p>We may safely say that Dr. Inglis was one of
the finest types of women produced by the ideals
and inspiring purposes of the generation to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
she belonged. She was born when a woman was
the reigning Sovereign, and when her influence and
power were at its height. Four years after her
birth the Reform Bill of 1868 was to make the
first claim for women as citizens in the British
Parliament. The Married Woman’s Property Act,
and the laws affecting Divorce, had recognised them
as something else than the goods and chattels or
the playthings and bondwomen of the ‘predominant
partner.’ Mary Somerville had convinced
the world that a woman could have a
brain. Timidly, and yet resolutely, women were
claiming a higher education, and Universities were
slamming to their doors, with a petty horde of
maxims claimed to be based on divine authority.
Women pioneers mounted platforms and asserted
‘Rights,’ and qualified for jealously closed professions&mdash;always,
from the first, upheld and companied
by ‘Greathearts,’ men few but chosen,
who, like John Inglis, recognised that no community
was the stronger for keeping its people, be
they black or white, male or female, in any form
of ignorance or bonded serfdom.</p>

<p>As Elsie grew up, she found herself walking in
the new age. Doors were set ajar, if not fully
opened. The first wave of ridicule and of conscientious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
objections had spent its force. A girl’s
school might play games decorously and not lose
all genteel deportment. Girls might show a love
of knowledge, and no longer be hooted as blue-stockings.
The use of the globes and cross-stitch
gave place to learning which might fit them
to be educated, and useful members of the community.
Ill-health ceased to be considered part
of the curse of Eve, to be borne with swooning
resignation on the wide sofas of the early Victorian
Age. Ignorance and innocence were not recognised
as twin sisters, and women, having eaten of the
tree of knowledge, looked round a world which
prided itself on giving equal justice to all men,
and discovered that very often that axiom covered
a multitude of sins of injustice against all womankind.</p>

<p>It was through Elsie’s professional life that she
learnt to know how often the law was against the
woman’s best interests, and it was always in connection
with some reform that she longed to
initiate, that she expressed a desire for the Vote.</p>

Confession and everything except Home Rule! The
amusing thing about women preaching is that they do
it, but as it is not in the churches it is not supposed
to be in opposition to Paul. They are having lots of
meetings in the hall downstairs; every single one of
them is addressed by a woman. But, of course, they
could not give the same address in a church and with
men listening! At Queen Margaret’s here, they are

the lecturer on that subject in the University, but then,
of course it is not “Divinity.”’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The opponents to Woman’s Franchise admittedly
occupied an illogical position, and Elsie’s abounding
sense of humour never failed to make use of
all the opportunities of laughter which the many
absurdities of the long fight evoked. No one with
that sense as highly developed could ever turn
cynical or bitter. It was only when cruelty and
injustice came under her ken that a fine scorn
dominated her thought and speech. She gives to
her father some of these instances:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘I got a paper to sign to thank the M.P.’s who voted
for Sir A. Rollitt’s Woman’s Suffrage Bill. I got it
filled up in half a minute. I wish she had sent half
a dozen. There is no question among women who have
to work for themselves about wanting the suffrage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
It is the women who are safe and sound in their own
drawing-rooms who don’t see what on earth they want
it for.</p>

<p>‘I have just been so angry! A woman came in
yesterday very ill. A. took down her case, and thought
she would have to have an operation. Then her
husband arrived, and calmly said she was to go home,
because he could not look after the children. So I
said that if she went she went on her own responsibility,
for I would not give my consent. He said the baby
was ill. I said, “Well, take it to a hospital.” Then
it turned out it was not ill, but had cried last night.
I said I saw very well what it was, that he had had a
bad night, and had just determined that his wife should
have the bad night to-night, even though she was ill,
instead of him. He did look ashamed of himself,
selfish cad! Helpless creature, he could not even
arrange for some one to come in and take charge of
those children unless his wife went home to do it. She
had got some one yesterday, but he had had a row with
her. I gave him my mind pretty clearly, but I went in
just now to find she had gone. I said she was stupid.
So one woman said, “It was not ’er fault, Miss; ’e
would have it.”</p>

<p>‘I wonder when married women will learn they have
any other duty in the world than to obey their husbands.
They were not even her children&mdash;they were step-children.
You don’t know what trouble we have here
with the husbands. They will come in the day before
the operation, after the woman has been screwed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to it, and worry them with all sorts of outside things,
and want them home when they are half dying. Any
idea that anybody is to be thought of but themselves
never enters their lordly minds, and the worst of it is
these stupid idiots of women don’t seem to think so
either: “’E wants it, Miss,” settles the question. I
always say&mdash;“It does not matter one fig what he wants.
The question is what you want.” They don’t seem to
think they have any right to any individual existence.
Well, I feel better now, but I wish I could have scragged
that beast. I have to go to the wards now!</p>

<p>‘We had another row with a tyrannical husband. I
did not know whether to be most angry with him or his
fool of a wife. She had one of the most painful things
anybody can have, an abscess in her breast. It was so
bad Miss Webb would not do anything for it in the
out-patients’, but said she was to come in at once. The
woman said she would go and arrange for somebody
to look after her baby and come back at six. At six
appeared her lord and master. “<em>I</em> cannot let my wife
come in, as the baby is not old enough to be left with
anybody else.” Did you ever hear anything so
monstrous? That one human being is to settle for
another human being whether she is to be cured or not.
I asked him whether he knew how painful it was, and if
he had to bear the pain. Miss Webb appealed to him,
that he <em>was</em> responsible for his wife’s health, for he
seemed to assume he was not. Both grounds were far
above his intellect, either his responsibility or his wife’s
rights. He just stood there like an obstinate mule.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
We told him it was positively brutal, and that he was to
go <em>at once</em> and get a good doctor home with him if he
would not let her in. Of course, he did not.</p>

<p>‘What a fool the woman must have been to have
educated him up to that. There really was no necessity
for her to stay out because he said she was to&mdash;poor
thing. Miss Webb and I have struck up a great
friendship as the result. After we had both fumed
about for some time, I said, “Well, the only way to
educate that kind of man, or that kind of woman, is
to get the franchise.” Miss Webb said, “Bravo, bravo,”
then I found she was a great franchise woman, and has
been having terrible difficulties with her L.W.A. here.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The writer may add one more to these instances.
Suffrage meetings were of a necessity much alike,
and the round of argument was much the same.
Spade-work had to be done among men and women
who had the mental outlook of these patients and
the overlords of their destiny. Meetings were
rarely enthusiastic or crowded, and it was often
like speaking into the heart of a pincushion. To
one of these meetings Dr. Inglis came by train
straight from her practice. In memory’s halls all
meetings are alike, but one stands out, where Dr.
Inglis illustrated her argument by a fact in her
day’s experience. The law does not permit an
operation on a married woman without her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
husband’s consent. That day the consent had
been refused, and the woman was to be left to
lingering suffering from which only death could
release her. The voice and the thrill which pervaded
speaker and audience as Dr. Inglis told the
tale and pointed the moral, remains an abiding
memory.</p>

<p>Her politics were Liberal, and, what was more
remarkable, she was a convinced Home Ruler.
Those who believe that women in politics naturally
take the line of the home, may find here a very
strong instance of the independent mind, producing
no rift within the lute that sounded such a perfect
note of unison between her and the prevailing
influence of her youth. Mr. Inglis had done his
work in India, and his politics were of an Imperialist
rather than that of a ‘Home Ruler All
Round.’ When Mr. Gladstone introduced his
Home Rule Bill of 1893, Elsie complains of the
obstructive talk in Parliament. Mr. Inglis gently
says she seems to wish it passed without discussion.
Elsie replies on the points she thinks salient and
likely to work, and wonders why they should
not commend themselves to sense and not words.
The family have recollections of long and not
acrimonious debates well sustained on either side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>She was a member of the W.L.F., and was always
impatient of the way Party was placed before the
Franchise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘I was sorry to see how the Suffrage question was
pushed into the background by Lady Aberdeen.
However, I shall stick to the Federation, and bring
them to their senses on that point as far as my influence
goes. It is simply sham Liberalism that will not
recognise that it is a real Liberal question (1893).</p>

<p>‘That is a capital letter of Miss M‘Laren’s. It
is quite true, and women are awful fools to truckle to
their party, instead of putting their foot down, about
the Franchise. You would certainly hear more about
wife murders than you do at present, if the women had
a vote.</p>

<p>‘Do you know what they said at the Liberal Club
the other day in answer to some deputation, or appeal,
or rather it was said, in the discussion, that the Liberal
Party would do all they could to remedy abuses and
give women justice, but the vote they would not give,
because they would put a power into women’s hand
which could never be taken away. Plain speaking,
was it not?</p>

<p>‘Did I tell you that I have to speak at a drawing-room
meeting on Woman’s Suffrage? Mrs. Elmy
asked me to. I had just refused to write a paper for
her on the present state of medical education in the
country, for I thought that would be too great cheek in
a house surgeon, so I did not like to refuse the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>‘The drawing-room meeting yesterday was very
good. I got there late, and found a fearfully and
awfully fashionable audience being harangued by a
very smart-looking man, who spoke uncommonly well,
and was saying everything I meant to say.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Elmy smiled and nodded away to me, and
suddenly it flashed on me that I was to second the
motion this man was speaking to. I was in such an
awful funk that I got cool, and got up and told them
that I did not think Mr. Wilkins had left any single
thing for me to say; however, as things struck people
in different ways I should simply tell them how it
struck me, and then went ahead with what I meant
to say when I got in. Mrs. Elmy was quite pleased,
and several people came up afterwards, and said I
had got on all right. Mrs. Elmy said, I had not repeated
Mr. W., only emphasised him. He was such a
fluent speaker, he scared me awfully.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The decade that saw the controversy of Home
Rule for Ireland, was the first that brought women
prominently into political organisations. Many
women’s associations were formed, and the religious
aspect as between Ulster and the South interested
many very deeply. Elsie was not a Liberal-Unionist,
and, as she states her case to her father,
there is much that shows that she was thinking
the matter out for herself, on lines which were
then fresher than they are to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>From Glasgow, in 1891, she writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I have spent a wicked Sunday. I read all the
morning, and then went up to the Infirmary to bandage
with Dr. D. Dr. T. says I am quite sure to be plucked,
after such worldliness. I have discovered he is an
Australian from Victoria. Dr. D. is an Aberdeen man
and a great admirer of George Smith. Also, a violent
Home Ruler. Never mind about the agricultural
labourer, Papa dear! I am afraid Gladstone’s majority
won’t be a working one, and we shall have the whole
row over again in six months. Dr. D. says every
available voter has been seized by the scruff of his
neck and made to vote this time. And, six months
hence there’ll be no fresh light on the situation, and
we’ll be where we are now. I should not wonder
if the whole thing makes us devise some plan for
one Imperial Parliament and local government for
Ireland, Scotland, and the Colonies, ending in making
the integrity of the Empire “and unity of the English
speaking race” more apparent than it is now, <em>and</em>
with the Irish contented and managing their own
affairs in their own mad way. Our future trouble is
with the Labour Party.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Gladstone has been so engrossed with his H.R.
measure that he does not seem to have noticed these
other questions that have been quickly growing, and
he has made two big blunders about Woman’s Suffrage
and the Labour question. I have no doubt these men

they say. It is no good shutting our eyes to the facts

<p>‘As to Mr. D., I am very much afraid you would
not agree with him. He is a rank Socialist. The only
point in which he agrees with you is that he would
make everybody do what he thinks right. Only his
ideas of right are very different from yours. He believes
in an eight-hour day, local option, and State-owned
mines. His chief amusement at present is arguing
with me. He generally gets angry, and says, “I argue
like a woman,” but he always pluckily begins again.
He was a tradesman, and gave it up because he says
you cannot be an honest tradesman nowadays. He is
studying medicine; the last day I worked at “brains”
he rampaged about the room arguing about the unearned
increment. I tell him he must come and argue
in Edinburgh&mdash;I have not time at present.</p>

<p>‘I will tell you what I think of the Home Rule Bill
to-morrow&mdash;that is to say, if I have time to read it. It
is really a case of officers and men here just now. I
can’t say “go on” instead of “come on.” I cannot
order cold spongings and hot fomentations by the dozen
and then sit in my room and read the newspapers,
can I?’</p>

<p>‘What do you think of Lord Salisbury’s speech,
inciting to rebellion and civil war? Now, don’t think
of it as Lord Salisbury and Ulster, but think of it as
advice given by Mr. Gladstone to the rest of Ireland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
If you like to take the lead into your own hands and
march on Dublin; I don’t know that any Government
would care to use the forces of the Crown against you.
You will be quite justified because the Government
of your country is in the hands of your hereditary foes.
There is only one good point in Lord Salisbury’s speech,
and that is that he does not sham that the Ulster men
are Irishmen. He calls them a colony from this
country. Lord S. must have been feeling desperate
before he made that speech.’</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date">
‘<i>1894</i>.
</p>

<p>‘I think Mr. Chamberlain’s speech was very clever.
It was this special Home Rule Bill he pulled to pieces,
and one could not help feeling that that would have
been the result whatever the Bill had been, if it had
been introduced by anybody but Mr. C. His argument
seemed to be in favour of Imperial Federation, as far
as I could make out. I have no doubt the Bill can be
very much improved in committee, but the groundwork
of it is all right. The two Houses and the gradual
giving over of the police and land, when they have had
time to find their feet. As to the retaining the Irish
members in Parliament being totally illogical, there is
nothing in that; we always make illogical things work.
And the Irish members must stay.</p>

<p>‘I <em>do</em> like Mr. Balfour. He is so honest. I expect
he hates the Irish Party as much as any man, but he
spoke up for them all the same. If he had not, I don’t
believe Mr. Chamberlain and some of the others would
have spoken as they did. The Conservative Party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
was quite inclined to laugh at the paid stipendiaries until
Mr. Balfour spoke.</p>

<p>‘I have been reading up the Bishop of Chester’s
scheme and the Direct Veto Bill. I don’t like his
scheme. It would be very nice to turn all the pubs
into coffee-houses, but a big company over whom the
ratepayers have no control would be just as likely to
do what would pay best, as the tramway companies
now, who work their men seventeen hours and their
horses three, at a stretch. It would be quite a different
thing to put the pubs under the Town and County
Councils. As to this Bill it is not to stop people drinking,
but simply to shut up pubs. A man can still buy his
whisky and get drunk in his own house, but a community
says, “We won’t have the nuisance of a pub
at every corner,” and I am not sure that they have not
that right, just as much as the private individual has
to get drunk if he chooses. A great many men would
keep straight if the temptation were not thrown in
their faces. The system of licences was instituted for
the good of the public, not the good of the publican.</p>

<p>‘The Elections will be three weeks after my exam.
Dearest Papa!&mdash;There is as much chance of Mr.
Gladstone being beaten in Midlothian as there is of a
Conservative majority.’</p>

<p>Another friend writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘I should like to send you a recollection of her in
the early Nineties. My friend, Dr. Jessie MacGregor,
wrote to my home in Rothesay, asking us to put up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Dr. Inglis, who was to give an address at a Sanitary
Congress to be held there. It was, I believe, her first
public appearance, and she did do well. One woman
alone on a platform filled with well-known doctors from
all parts! Her subject was advocating women as
sanitary inspectors. She was one of the pioneers in
that movement also. I can well remember her, a slim
little girl in black, fearless as ever, doing her part.
After she had finished, there was a running criticism
of her subject. Many against her view, few for the
cause on which she was speaking. It was an unique
experience. The discussion got quite hot. One well-known
doctor asked us to picture his dear friend Elsie
Inglis carrying out a six-foot smallpox patient.</p>

<p>‘I think she was the first lady medical to speak at
a Congress. It was such a pleasure to entertain her,
she was so quiet and unobtrusive, and yet so humorous.
I never met her again, but I could never forget her,
though we were just like ships that pass in the night.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of her Suffrage organisers, Miss Bury, gives
a vivid picture of her work in the Suffrage cause:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘It was Dr. Elsie Inglis who brought me to Scotland,
and sent me to organise Suffrage societies in the
Highlands. I speak of her as I knew her, the best of
chiefs, so kind and encouraging and appreciative of
one’s efforts, even when they were not always crowned
with success. I remember saying I was disappointed
because the hall was only about three-quarters full, and
her reply was, “My dear, I was not counting the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
I was thinking of the efforts which had brought those
who were there.”</p>

<p>‘Her letters were an inspiration. She gave one the
full responsibility of one’s position, and always expected
the best. Resolutely direct, and straightforward in
her dealings with me as a subordinate worker, she
never failed to tell me of any word of appreciation that
reached her, as she also told me candidly if she heard
of any criticism. She had such a big, generous mind,
even condescending to give an opportunity for argument
when there was any difference of opinion, and
absolutely tolerant and kind when one did not agree
with her.</p>

<p>‘She was always considerate of one’s health, and insisted
that the hours laid down for work were not to be
exceeded, or, if this was unavoidable, that the time must
be taken off as soon as possible afterwards. She only
saw difficulties to conquer them, and I well remember
in one of her letters from Lazaravatz, she wrote so
characteristically&mdash;“the work is most interesting,
bristling with difficulties.”</p>

<p>‘My happiest recollection is of a visit to the Highlands,
to speak at some Suffrage meetings I had arranged
for her. In the train she was always busy writing,
in that beautiful clear characteristic hand, like herself,
triumphing over the jolting of the Highland Railway,
as she did later in Serbia. In the early morning she
had to catch a train at Inverness, and we went by motor
from Nairn. For once the writing was laid aside, and
she gave herself up to the enjoyment of the sunrise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>

and the beautiful lights on the Ross-shire hills, as we
travelled along the shores of the Moray Firth. When
the car broke down, out came the despatch case again,
while the chauffeur and I put on the Stepney. There
was no complaining about the lost train, a wire was
sent to the committee apologising for her absence, and
then she immediately turned her attention to other
business.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One who first came under her influence as a
patient, and became a warm friend, gives some
reminiscences. Her greeting to the elect at the
beginning of the year was, ‘A good new year, and
the Vote <em>this</em> year.’</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I remember once, as we descended the steps of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles’ after attending a service at which the Edinburgh
Town Council was present, she spoke joyfully
of the time coming when we, the women of Edinburgh
and of Scotland, would “help to build the New Jerusalem,
with the weapon ready to our hand&mdash;the Vote.”’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The year 1906 brought the Liberals into political
power, and with the great wave of democratic
enthusiasm which gave the Government of Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman an enormous majority
there came other expressions of the people’s will.</p>

<p>The Franchise for women had hitherto been of
academic interest in the community: a crank,
many thought it, like total abstinence or Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Science. The claims of women were frequently
brought before Parliament by private members,
and if the Bill was not ‘talked out,’ it was talked
round, as one of the best jests of a Parliamentary
holiday. The women who advocated it were
treated with tolerance, their public advocacy was
deemed a <i>tour de force</i>, and their portraits were
always of the nature of caricatures, except those
in <cite>Punch</cite>, where the opponent was caricatured,
and the women immortalised.</p>

<p>The Liberal party found its right wing mainly
composed of Labour, and Socialist members were
returned to Parliament. From that section of
thought sprang the militant movement, and the
whole question of the enfranchisement of women
took on a different aspect.</p>

<p>This chapter does not attempt to give a history
of the ‘common cause,’ or the reasons for the
rapid way it came to the front, and ranked
with Ireland as among the questions which, left
unsettled, became a thorn in the side of any
Government that attempted to govern against, or
leaving outside the expressed will of the people.</p>

<p>This is no place to examine the causes which,
along with the militant movement, but always
separated from them, poured such fresh life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
vigour into the old constitutional and law-abiding
effort to procure the free rights of citizenship for
women.</p>

<p>The pace quickened to an extent which was
bewildering. Where a dozen meetings a year had
been the portion of many speakers, they were
multiplied by the tens and scores. Organisations
had to be expanded. A fighting fund collected,
meetings arranged, debates were held all over the
country and among all classes. A press, which
had never written up the subject while its advocates
were law-abiding, tumbled over each other
to advertise every movement of all sections of
suffragists. It must be admitted the militants
gave them plenty of copy, and the constitutionalists
had an uneasy sense that their stable companions
would kick over the traces in some embarrassing
and unexpected way on every new occasion. Still
the tide flowed steadily for the principle, and
those who had its guidance in Parliament and the
country had to use all the strength of the movement
in getting it well organised and carefully worked.
Societies were federated, and the greatly growing
numbers co-ordinated into a machine which could
bring the best pressure to bear on Parliament.
The well-planned Federation of Scottish Suffrage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Societies owed much to Dr. Inglis’ gift of organisation
and of taking opportunity by the hand. She
was Honorary Secretary to the Scottish Federation,
and in those fighting years between 1906 and
1914 she impressed herself much on its policy. In
the early years of her professional life, she used
gaily to forecast for herself a large and paying
practice. Her patients never suffered, but she
sacrificed her professional prospects in a large
measure for her work for the Franchise. She gave
her time freely, and she raised money at critical
times by parting with what was of value and in her
power to give. Perhaps, the writer may here again
give her own reminiscences. Her fellowship with
Dr. Inglis was all too rarely social; they met
almost entirely in their suffrage work. To know
Dr. Inglis at all was to know her well. The transparent
sincerity and simplicity of her manner left
nothing to be discovered. One felt instinctively
she was a comrade one could ‘go tiger-hunting
with,’ and to be in her company was to be sustained
by a true helpmate. We were asked to
speak together. Invited by the elect, and sometimes
by the opponents to enjoy hospitality, Dr.
Inglis was rarely able to come in time for the
baked meats before we ascended the platform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and uttered our platitudes to rooms often empty
woodyards, stuck about with a remnant of those
who would be saved. She usually met us on the
platform, having arrived by the last train, and
obliged to leave by the first. But she never came
stale or discouraged. There was always the smile at
the last set-back, the ready joke at our opponents,
the subtle sense that she was out to win, the
compelling force of sustained effort that made at
least one of her yoke-fellows ashamed of the faint
heart that could never hope to win through.
Sometimes we travelled back together; more often
we would meet next day in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles’ after the
daily service, and our walk home was always a
cheer. ‘Never mind’ the note to discouragement.
‘Remember this or that in our favour;
our next move must be in this direction.’ And
the thought was always there (if her unselfconsciousness
prevented it being spoken&mdash;as one wishes
to-day it had been)&mdash;‘The meeting went, because
you were there and set your whole soul on “willing”
it through.’</p>

<p>She had no sympathy with militantism. There
was no better fighter with legitimate weapons,
but she saw how closely the claim to do wrong
that good might come was related to anarchy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and her sense of true citizenship was outraged by
law-breaking which, to her clear judgment, could
only retard the ultimate triumph of a cause rooted
in all that was just and righteous. She was not
confused by any cross-currents of admiration for
individual courage and self-sacrifice, and her one
desire was to see that the Federation was ‘purged’
of all those who belonged to the forces of disintegration.</p>

<p>She had the fruit of her political sagacity, and
her fearless pursuit after integrity in deed and in
word. When the moment came when she was to
go to the battle fronts of the world, a succourer of
many, she went in the strength of the Suffrage
women of Scotland. They were her shield and
buckler, and their loyal support of her work and
its ideals was her exceeding great reward. Without
their organised strength she could never have
called into existence those units and their equipment
which have justly earned the praises of
nations allied in arms.</p>

<p>With the rise of the militant movement, the
whole Suffrage cause passed through a cloud of
opprobrium and almost universal objurgation.
Women were all tarred with the same stick, and
fell under one condemnation. It is now of little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
moment to recall this, except in as much as it
affected Elsie Inglis. The Scottish Suffrage societies,
who gave their organisation and their workers to
start the Scottish Women’s Hospitals, found that
the community desired to forget the unpopular
Suffrage, and to remember only the Scottish Hospitals.
Speakers for the work that Dr. Inglis was
doing were asked to avoid ‘the common cause.’
No one who knew her would consent to deny by
implication one of the deepest mainsprings of her
work. The Churches were equally timid in aught
that gave comfort or consolation to those who
were loyal to their Christian social ideal for women.
No organised society owes more to the administrative
work of women than does the Christian
Church throughout the world. No body of administrators
have been slower to perceive that
women in responsible positions would be a strength
to the Church than have been the clergy of the
Church. The writer of <cite>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</cite> puts
into the mouth of the clerical type of that day
the argument that the Old Testament gave an
historic basis for the enslavement of races, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Paul had sanctioned slavery in the New Testament.
The spirit of Christianity has raised women
from a ‘low estate,’ and women owe everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to the results of Christianity; but the ecclesiastical
mind has never shaken off the belief that they are
under a special curse from the days of Eden, and
that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s outlook on women in his day was
the last revelation as to their future position in
a jealously-guarded corporation. Which of us,
acquainted with the Church history of our day,
but remembers the General Assembly when the
women missionaries were first invited to stand
by their fellow-workers and be addressed by the
Moderator on their labours and sufferings in a
common cause? It was a great shock to the
fathers and brethren that their sex should not
disqualify them from standing in the Assembly,
which would have more democratic weight in the
visible Church on earth if some of its elected lay
members were women serving in the courts of the
Church. In this matter and in many others concerning
women, the Church is not yet triumphant
over its prejudices bedded in the geological structure
of Genesis.</p>

<p>In all periods of the enfranchisement struggle
there were individual clergy who aided women
with their warm advocacy and the helpful direction
of thought. Elsie Inglis was a leader of this movement
in its connection with a high Christian ideal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of the citizenship of women. To those who
gathered in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Margaret’s, the church of Parliament
in history, to commemorate all her works
begun and ended as a member of Christ’s Church
here on earth, it was fitting that Bishop Gore, who
had so consistently upheld the cause, should speak
of her work as one who had helped to win the
equality of women in a democratic, self-governing
State.</p>

<p>This memoir would utterly fail to reproduce a
picture of Dr. Inglis if it did not emphasise how
her spirit was led and disciplined, tempered and
steeled, through this long and fiery trial to the
goal of a leading ideal. The contest trained her
for her splendid achievements in overcoming all
obstacles in ministering to the sufferings of nations,
‘rightly struggling to be free.’ Her friend, Miss
Wright, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘We did not always agree. Many were the arguments
we had with her, but she was always willing to
understand another point of view and willing to allow
for difference of opinion. She was very fair-minded
and reasonable, and deplored the excesses of the militant
suffragettes. She was in no sense a man-hater;
to her the world was composed of men and women, and
she thought it a mistake to exalt the one unduly over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the other. She was never embittered by her struggle
for the position of women. She loved the fight, and
the endeavour, and to arrive at any point just meant a
fresh setting forward to another further goal.</p>

<p>‘From her girlhood onward, her effort was to free
and broaden life for other women, to make the world
a better place to live in.</p>

<p>‘I had a letter this week from Annie Wilson, Elsie’s
great friend. She says, “It seems to me Elsie’s whole
life was full of championship of the weak, and she was
so strong in maintaining what was right. I feel sure
she has inspired many. I remember once saying in
connection with some work I was going to begin, ‘I
wonder if I shall be able,’ and Elsie saying in her bright
way, ‘What man has done man can do.’ I am so glad
that she had the opportunity of showing her great
administrative capacity, and that her power is known
and acknowledged. She is a great woman. I cannot
tell you what it will be not to have her welcome to
look forward to when I come home.”</p>

<p>‘Elsie had in many respects what is, perhaps wrongly,
called a man’s mind. She was an Imperialist in the
very best sense, and had high ideals for her country
and people. She was a very womanly woman, never
affecting mannish ways as a pose. If she seemed a
strong-minded woman it was because she had strenuous
work to do. She was never “a lone woman.” She
was always one of a family, and in the heart of the
family. Elsie always had the <em>lovingest</em> appreciation
and backing from her nearest and dearest, and that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
wide and varied circle. So, also, she did not need to
fight for her position; it has been said of her, “Whenever
she began to speak her pleasant well-bred accent and
manner gained her a hearing.” She was ever a fighter,
but it was because she wanted those out in the cold
and darkness to come into the love and light which
she herself experienced and sought after always more
fully.</p>

<p>‘We looked forward to more frequent meetings when
working days were done. Now she has gone forward
to the great work beyond:</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Elsie Inglis</span> took up practice in Edinburgh, and
worked in a happy partnership with the late Dr.
Jessie MacGregor, until the latter left Scotland for
work in America.</p>

<p>When the University of Edinburgh admitted
women to the examinations for degrees in medicine,
Dr. Inglis graduated M.B., C.M. in 1899. From
that date onwards her practice, her political and
suffrage work, and the founding of the Hospice in
the High Street of Edinburgh, as a nursing home
and maternity centre staffed by medical women,
occupied a life which grew and strengthened amid
so many and varied experiences.</p>

<p>Her father’s death deprived her of what had
been the very centre and mainspring of her existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
As she records the story of his passing on,
she says that she cannot imagine life without him,
and that he had been so glad to see her begin her
professional career. She was not one to lose her
place in the stream of life from any morbid inaction
or useless repining. She shared the spirit
of the race from which she had sprung, a reaching
forward to obtain the prize of life fulfilled with
service, and she had inherited the childlike faith
and confidence which inspired their belief in the
Father of Spirits.</p>

<p>Elsie lost in her father the one who had made
her the centre of his thoughts and of his most
loving watchfulness. From the day that her home
with him was left unto her desolate, she was to
become a centre to many of her father’s wide
household, and, even as she had learnt from him,
she became a stay and support to many of his
children’s children.</p>

<p>The two doctors started practice in Atholl
Place, and later on they moved into 8 Walker
Street, an abode which will always be associated
with the name of Dr. Elsie Inglis.</p>

<p>Mrs. M‘Laren says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘My impressions of their joint house are all pleasant
ones. They got on wonderfully together, and in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
thing seemed to appreciate one another’s good qualities.
They were very different, and had in many ways
a different outlook. I remember Jessie saying once,
“Elsie is so exceptionally generous in her attitude of
mind, it would be difficult not to get on with her!”
They both held their own opinions on various subjects
without the difference of opinion really coming between
them. Elsie said once about the arrangement,
“It has all the advantages of marriage without any
of its disabilities.” We used always to think they did
each other worlds of good. I know how I always enjoyed
a visit to them if it was only for an afternoon
or some weeks. There was such an air of freedom in
the whole house. You did what you liked, thought
what you liked, without any fear of criticism or of
being misunderstood.</p>

<p>‘I do not know much about her practice, as medicine
never interested me, but I believe at one time, before
the Suffrage work engrossed her so much, she was
making quite a large income.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Professionally she suffered under two disabilities:
the restricted opportunities for clinical work in
the days when she was studying her profession,
combined with the constant interruptions which
the struggle against the medical obstructionists
necessitated; secondly, the various stages in the
political fight incident to obtaining that wider
enfranchisement which aimed at freeing women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
from all those lesser disabilities which made them
the helots of every recognised profession and
industry.</p>

<p>When in the Scottish Women’s Hospitals abroad,
Dr. Inglis rapidly acquired a surgical skill, under
the tremendous pressure of work, which often kept
her for days at the operating-table, which showed
what a great surgeon she might have been, given
equal advantages in the days of her peace practice.</p>

<p>Dr. Inglis lost no opportunity of enlarging her
knowledge. She was a lecturer on Gynecology in
the Medical College for Women which had been
started later than Dr. Jex Blake’s school, and was
on slightly broader lines. After she had started
practice she went to study German clinics; she
travelled to Vienna, and later on spent two months
in America studying the work and methods of
the best surgeons in New York, Chicago, and
Rochester.</p>

<p>She advocated, at home and abroad, equal opportunities
for work and study in the laboratories for
both men and women students. She maintained
that the lectures for women only were not as good
as those provided for the men, and that the women
did not get the opportunity of thorough laboratory
practice before taking their exams. She thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
came into conflict with the University authorities,
who refused to accept women medical students
within the University, or to recognise extra-mural
mixed classes in certain subjects. Step by step
Dr. Inglis fought for the students. ‘With a great
price’ she might truly say she had purchased her
freedom, and nothing would turn her aside. If
one avenue was closed, try another. If one
Principal was adamant, his day could not last for
ever; prepare the way for his successor. Indomitable,
unbeaten, unsoured, Dr. Inglis, with
the smiling, fearless brow, trod the years till the
influence of the ‘red planet Mars’ opened to her
and others the gate of opportunity. She had
achieved many things, and was far away from
her city and its hard-earned practice when at
length, in 1916, the University, under a new ‘open-minded,
generous-hearted Head,’ opened its doors
to women medical students.</p>

<p>There were other things, besides her practice,
which Dr. Inglis subordinated in these years to the
political enfranchisement of women. It has been
shown in a previous chapter how keen were her
political beliefs. She joined the Central Edinburgh
Women’s Liberal Association in its earliest
organised years. She acted as Vice-President in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
it for sixteen years, and was one of its most active
members.</p>

<p>Mr. Gulland, the Liberal Whip, knew the value
of her work, and must have had reason to respect
the order in which she placed her political creed&mdash;first
the citizenship of women, then the party
organisation. He speaks of her fearless partisanship
and aloof attitude towards all local political
difficulties. An obstacle to her was a thing to be
overcome, not to be sat down before. Any one
in politics who sees what is right, and cannot
understand any reason why the action should not
be straight, rather than compromising, is a help
to party agents at rare intervals; normally such
minds cause anxiety. Her secretary, Miss Cunningham,
says about her place in the Liberal
organisation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Not only as a speaker&mdash;though as that she was
invaluable&mdash;but as one who mixed freely with all our
members, with her sympathy, in fact, her enthusiasm
for everything affecting the good of women, she won
respect and liking on every side. It was not until she
became convinced that she could help forward the great
cause for women better by being unattached to any
party organisation that she severed her connection with
the Liberal Party. Regretted as that severance was by
all, we understood her point of view so well that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
recognised there was no other course open to her. Her
firm grasp of and clear insight into matters political
made her a most valued colleague, especially in times
of difficulty, when her advice was always to be relied
upon.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1901 she was a member of the Women’s
Liberal League, a branch of the W.L.A. which
split off at the time of the Boer War, in opposition
to the ‘Little Englanders.’ Dr. Inglis was on its
first committee, and lent her drawing-room for
meetings, addressing other meetings on the Imperialist
doctrines born in that war. When that
phase of politics ended, the League became an
educational body and worked on social and factory
legislation.</p>

<p>Among her other enterprises was the founding
of the Muir Hall of Residence for Women Students
at the University. Many came up from the
country, and, like herself in former days in Glasgow,
had to find suitable, and in many cases uncomfortable,
lodgings.</p>

<p>Principal Muir’s old Indian friendship with Mr.
Inglis had been most helpful in former years, and
now Lady Muir and other friends of the women
students started a Residence in George Square for
them, and Miss Robertson was appointed its first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
warden. Dr. Inglis was Hon. Secretary to the
Muir Hall till she died, and from its start was a
moving spirit in all that stood for the comfort of
the students. She attended them when they were
ill, and was always ready to help them in their
difficulties with her keen, understanding advice.
The child of her love, amid all other works, was her
Maternity Hospice. Of this work Miss Mair, who
was indeed ‘a nursing mother’ to so many of the
undertakings of women in the healing profession,
writes of Dr. Inglis’ feeling with perfect understanding:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘To Dr. Inglis’ clear vision, even in her early years of
student life, there shone through the mists of opposition
and misunderstandings a future scene in which a
welcome recognition would be made of women’s services
for humanity, and with a strong, glad heart she joined
with other pioneers in treading “the stony way”
that leads to most reforms. Once landed on the firm
rock of professional recognition, Dr. Inglis set about
the philanthropic task of bringing succour and helpful
advice to mothers and young babies and expectant
mothers in the crowded homes in and about the High
Street. There, with the help of a few friends, she
founded the useful little Hospice that we trust now to
see so developed and extended by an appreciative
public, that it will merit the honoured name “The Dr.
Elsie Inglis Memorial Hospice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>‘This little Hospice lay very near the heart of its
founder&mdash;she loved it&mdash;and with her always sensitive
realisation of the needs of the future, she was convinced
that this was a bit of work on the right lines for recognition
in years to come. Some of us can recall the
kindling eye, the inspiring tones, that gave animation
to her whole being when talking of her loved Hospice.
She saw in it a possible future that might effect much,
not only for its patients, but for generations of medical
women.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With Dr. Elsie one idea always started another,
and ‘a felt want’ in any department of life always
meant an instantly conceived scheme of supplying
the need. Those who ‘came after’ sometimes felt
a breathless wonder how ways and means could be
found to establish and settle the new idea which
had been evolved from the fertile brain. The
Hospice grew out of the establishment of a nursing
home for working women, where they could be
cared for near their own homes. Through the
kindness of Dr. Barbour, a house was secured at a
nominal rent in George Square, and opened in
1901. That sphere of usefulness could be extended
if a maternity home could be started in a poorer
district. Thus the Hospice in the High Street was
opened in 1904. Dr. Inglis devoted herself to the
work. An operating theatre and eight beds were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
provided. The midwifery department grew so
rapidly that after a few years the Hospice became
a centre, one of five in Scotland, for training nurses
for the C.M.B. examination.</p>

<p>Dr. Inglis looked forward to a greater future for
it in infant welfare work, and she always justified
the device of the site as being close to where the
people lived, and in air to which they were accustomed.
Trained district nurses visited the people
in their own homes, and in 1910 there were more
cases than nurses to overtake them. In that year
the Hospice was amalgamated with Bruntsfield
Hospital; medical, surgical, and gynecological cases
were treated there, while the Hospice was devoted
entirely to maternity and infant welfare cases.</p>

<p>Dr. Inglis’ ‘vision’ was nearly accomplished
when she had a small ward of five beds for malnutrition
cases, a baby clinic, a milk depot, health
centres, and the knowledge that the Hospice has
the distinction of being the only maternity centre
run by women in Scotland. This affords women
students opportunities denied to them in other
maternity hospitals.</p>

<p>A probationer in that Hospice says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘Dr. Inglis’ idea was that everything, as far as
possible, should be made subservient to the comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of the patients. This was always considered when
planning the routine. She disapproved of the system
prevalent in so many hospitals of rousing the patients
out of sleep in the small hours of the morning in order
to get through the work of the wards. She would not
have them awakened before 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and she instituted
a cup of tea before anything else was done. To her
nurses she was very just and appreciative of good
work, and, if complaints were made against any one,
the wrongdoing had to be absolutely proved before she
would take action. She also insisted on the nurses
having adequate time off, and that it should not be
infringed upon.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These, in outline, are the interests which filled
the years after Dr. Elsie began her practice. Of
her work among the people living round her
Hospice, it is best told in the words of those who
watched for her coming, and blessed the sound of
her feet on their thresholds. Freely she gave them
of her best, and freely they gave her the love and
confidence of their loyal hearts.</p>

<p>Mrs. B. had been Dr. Inglis’ patient for twenty
years, and she had also attended her mother and
grandmother. Of several children one was called
Elsie Maud Inglis, and the child was christened
in the Dean Church by Dr. Williamson, who had
known Dr. Inglis as a child in India. The whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
family seem to have been her charge, for when
Mrs. B.’s husband returned from the South African
War, Dr. Inglis fought the War Office for nine
months to secure him a set of teeth, and, needless
to say, after taking all the trouble entailed by a
War Office correspondence, she was successful. A
son fought in the present war, and when Dr. Inglis
saw the death of a Private B., she sent a telegram
to the War Office to make sure it was not the son
of Mrs. B. She would never take any fees from
this family. On one occasion Mr. B. gave her
some feathers he had brought home from Africa.
She had them put in a new hat she had got for a
wedding, and came round before she went to the
festival to show them to the donor. Her cheery
ways ‘helped them all,’ and when a child of the
family broke its leg, and was not mending all
round in the Infirmary, Dr. Inglis was asked to go
and see her, and the child from then ‘went forrit.’</p>

<p>In another family there was some stomach weakness,
and three infants died. Dr. Inglis tried hard
to save the life of the third, a little boy, who was
evidently getting no nourishment. So anxious
was she, that she asked a sister who had recently
had a baby, to try if she could nurse the child.
This was done, the foster mother going every day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to the house, but they could not save the infant.
When the next one arrived, Dr. Inglis was so
determined the child should live, she came every
day, whatever were her engagements, to sterilise
the milk. The child throve under her care, and
grew up in health.</p>

<p>Another of these patients of her care ‘could not
control her feelings’ when speaking of the good
physician. It was evident the family had lost their
best friend. The husband spoke most warmly of
Dr. Inglis’ kindness to them. She would come
round, after she had finished her other work at
night, to bath the baby. When another child
was ill, she told the mother not to open the door
even if the King himself wished to come in. The
husband said she was so bright one felt the better
for her visit, ‘though her orders had to be obeyed
and no mistake, and she would tell you off at
once if you did not carry them out.’ If they
offered payment, she would say, ‘Now, go and
buy a nice chop for yourself.’</p>

<p>Another family had this story. Mr. G.: ‘That
woman has done more for the folk living between
Morrison Street and the High Street than all the
ministers in Edinburgh and Scotland itself ever
did for any one. She would never give in to difficulties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
She gave her house, her property, her
practice, her money to help others.’ Mrs. G. fell
ill after the birth of one of her children. Dr. Elsie
came in one night, made her a cup of tea and some
toast, and, as she failed to get well, she raised
money to keep her in a sanatorium for six months.
After she had been there one child, in charge of a
friend, fell ill, and finally died, Dr. Inglis doing all
she could to spare the absent mother and save the
child. When it died, she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. G.</span>,&mdash;You will have got the news
by now. I cannot tell you how sorry I am for you,
my dear. But you will believe, won’t you, that we
all did everything we could for your dear little boy.
Mrs. E. was simply goodness itself. Dr. H. and I saw
him three times a day between us, and yesterday we
saw him four times. When I sent you the card I hoped
the high temperature was due to his teeth, because his
pulse seemed good. However, later, Dr. H. telephoned
that she was afraid that his pulse was flagging, and he
died suddenly about one. Mr. G. has just been here;
you must get well, my dear, for his sake, and for the
sake of all the other little children. Poor little Johnnie
has had a great many troubles in his little life has he not?
But he is over them all now, dear little man. And the
God in whose <em>safe</em> keeping he is, comfort you, dear Mrs.
G.&mdash;Ever your sincere friend,</p>

<p class="signed">
‘<span class="smcap">Elsie Maud Inglis</span>.’
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The caretaker of the dispensary in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert’s
Mission in Morrison Street speaks of Dr. Inglis as
the true friend of all who needed her. She gave
an hour three mornings in the week, and if she
could not overtake all the cases in the time, she
would occasionally come back later in the day.</p>

<p>Another of her patients was the mother of
twelve children; six of them were ‘brought home’
by Dr. Inglis. She was a friend to them all, and
never minded what trouble she took. If they did
not send for her, wishing to spare her, she scolded
them for thinking of herself and not of their need
for her services. All the children loved her, and
they would watch from the window on her dispensary
days for her, and she would wave to them
across the street. She would often stop them in
the street to ask after their mother, and even after
she had been to Serbia and returned to Edinburgh,
she remembered about them and their home affairs.
She always made them understand that her orders
must be carried out. Once Mrs. C. was very ill,
and Dr. Inglis came to attend her. The eldest
girl was washing the floor, and Dr. Inglis told her
to go for some medicine. The girl continued to
finish the work she was at. ‘Child,’ said Dr. Inglis,
‘don’t you know that when I say a thing I mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
it?’ Another time she had told Mrs. C. to remain
in her bed till she came. Household cares were
pressing, and Mrs. C. rose to wash the dishes. Dr.
Inglis suddenly appeared at the door. ‘What did
I tell you? Do not touch another dish.’ And she
herself helped Mrs. C. back to bed. Later on two
of the children got scarlet fever, and Dr. Inglis
told the mother she was proud of her, as, through
her care, the infection did not spread in the family
or outside it.</p>

<p>The people in Morrison Street showed their
gratitude by collecting a little sum of money to
buy an electric lamp to light their doctor friend up
the dark staircase of the house. These were the
true mourners who stood round <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles’ with the
bairns she had ‘brought home’ on the day when
her earthly presence passed from their sight.
These were they who had fitted her for her strenuous
enterprises in the day when the battle was
set in array, and these were the people who knew
her best, and never doubted that when called
from their midst she would go forth strong in that
spirit which is given to the weak things of the
earth, and that it would be her part to strengthen
the peoples that had no might.</p>

<p>The Little Sisters of the Poor had a dispensary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anne, and Dr. Elsie had it in her charge
from 1903 to 1913, and the Sister Superior speaks
of the affection of the people and the good work
done among them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘“How often,” writes one in charge of the servant
department of the Y.W.C.A., “her deliberate tread has
brought confidence to me when getting heartless over
some of these poor creatures who would not rouse
themselves, judging the world was against them. Many
a time the patient fighting with circumstances needed
a sisterly word of cheer which Dr. Inglis supplied,
and sent the individual heartened and refreshed.
The expression on her face, <em>I mean business</em>, had a
wonderful uplift, while her acuteness in exactly describing
the symptoms to those who were in constant
contact gave a confidence which made her a power
amongst us.”’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A patient has allowed some of her written
prescriptions to be quoted. They were not of a
kind to be made up by a chemist:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I want you never to miss or delay meals. I want
you to go to bed at a reasonable time and go to sleep
early. I want you to do your work regularly, and to
take an interest in outside things&mdash;such as your church
and suffrage.’</p>

<p>‘We should not let these Things (with a capital T)
affect us so much. Our cause is too righteous for it to
be really affected by them&mdash;if we don’t weaken.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>‘My dear, the potter’s wheel isn’t a pleasant instrument.’</p>

<p>‘Go home and say your prayers.’</p>

<p>‘Realise what you are, a free born child of the
Universe. Perfection your Polar Star.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These stories of her healing of mind and body
might be endlessly multiplied. Sorrow and disease
are much the same whether they come to the rich
or the poor, and poverty is not always the worst
trial of many a sad tale. Dr. Elsie’s power of
sympathy and understanding was as much called
upon in her paying practice as among the very
poor. She made no distinction in what she gave;
her friendship was as ready as her trained skill.
There was one patient whose sufferings were largely
due to her own lack of will power. Elsie, after
prescribing, bent down and kissed her. It awoke
in the individual the sense that she was not ‘altogether
bad,’ and from that day forward there was
a newness of life.</p>

<p>From what sources of inner strength did she
increasingly minister in that sphere in which she
moved? ‘Thy touch has still its ancient power,’
and no one who knew this unresting, unhasting,
well-balanced life, but felt it had drawn its spiritual
strength from the deep wells of Salvation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>In these years the kindred points of heaven and
home were always in the background of her life.
Her sisters’ homes were near her in Edinburgh,
and when her brother Ernest died in India, in
1910, his widow and her three daughters came
back to her house. Her friendship and understanding
of all the large circle that called her aunt
was a very beautiful tie. The elder ones were
near enough to her own age to be companions to
her from her girlhood. Miss Simson says that she
was more like an elder sister to them when she
stayed with the family on their arrival from
Tasmania. ‘The next thing I remember about
her was when she went to school in Paris, she
promised to bring us home Paris dolls. She asked
us how we wanted them dressed, and when she
returned we each received a beautiful one dressed
in the manner chosen. Aunt Elsie was always
most careful in the choice of presents for each
individual. One always felt that she had thought
of and got something that she knew you wanted.
While on her way to Russia she sent me a cheque
because she had not been able to see anything
while at home. She wrote, “This is to spend on
something frivolous that you want, and not on
stockings or anything like that.”’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>‘It is not her great gifts that I remember now,’
says another of that young circle, ‘it is that she
was always such a darling.’</p>

<p>These nieces were often the companions of Dr.
Elsie’s holidays. She had her own ideas as to how
these should be spent. She always had September
as her month of recreation. She used to go away,
first of all, for a fortnight quite alone to some
out-of-the-way place, when not even her letters
were sent after her. She would book to a station,
get out, and bicycle round the neighbourhood till
she found a place she liked. She wanted scenery
and housing accommodation according to her mind.
Her first requirement was hot water for ‘baths.’
If that was found in abundance she was suited; if
it could not be requisitioned, she went elsewhere.
Her paintbox went with her, and when she returned
to rejoin or fetch away her family she
brought many impressions of what she had seen.
The holidays were restful because always well
planned. She loved enjoyment and happiness,
and she sought them in the spirit of real relaxation
and recreation. If weather or circumstances turned
out adverse, she was amused in finding some way
out, and if nothing else could be done she had a
power of seeing the ludicrous under all conditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
which in itself turned the rain-clouds of life into
bursts of sunlight.</p>

<p>Mrs. Inglis gives a happy picture of the life in
8 Walker Street, when she was the guest of Dr.
Inglis. Her love for the three nieces, the one in
particular who bore her name, and in whose medical
education she deeply interested herself, was great.</p>

<p>She used to return from a long day’s work, often
late, but with a mind at leisure from itself for the
talk of the young people. However late she was,
a hot bath preluded a dinner-party full of fun and
laughter, the account of all the day’s doings, and
then a game of bridge or some other amusement.
Often she would be anxious over some case, but
she used to say, ‘I have done all I know, I can
only sleep over it,’ and to bed and to sleep she
went, always using her will-power to do what was
best in the situation. Those who were with her
in the ‘retreats’ in Serbia or Russia saw the same
quality of self-command. If transport broke down,
then the interval had better be used for rest, in
the best fashion in which it could be obtained.</p>

<p>Her Sundays, as far as her profession permitted,
were days of rest and social intercourse with her
family and friends. After evening church she
went always to supper in the Simson family, often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
detained late by pacings to and fro with her
friends, Dr. and Mrs. Wallace Williamson, engaged
in some outpouring of the vital interests which
were absorbing her. One of the members of her
household says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘We all used to look forward to hearing all her doings
in the past week, and of all that lay before her in the
next. Sunday evening felt quite wrong and flat when
she was called out to a case and could not come to us.
It was the same with our summer holidays. Her visit
in September was the best bit of the holidays to us.
She laid herself out to be with us in our bathing and
golfing and picnics.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The house was ‘well run.’ Those who know
what is the highest meaning of service, have always
good servants, and Dr. Elsie had a faithful household.
Her cooks were all engaged under one
stipulation, ‘Hot water for any number of baths
at any time of the day or night,’ and the hot
water never failed under the most exacting conditions.
Her guests were made very comfortable,
and there was only one rigid rule in the house.
However late she came downstairs after any night-work,
there was always family prayers before breakfast.
The book she used was <cite>Euchologion</cite>, and
when in Russia asked that a copy should be sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
her. Her consulting-room was lined with bookshelves
containing all her father’s books, and of
these she never lost sight. Any guest might
borrow anything else in her house and forget to
return it, but if ever one of those books were
borrowed, it had to be returned, for the quest after
it was pertinacious. In her dress she became
increasingly particular, but only as the adornment,
not of herself, but of the cause of women as citizens
or as doctors. When a uniform became part of her
equipment for work, she must have welcomed it
with great enthusiasm. It is in the hodden grey
with the tartan shoulder straps, and the thistles
of Scotland that she will be clothed upon, in the
memory of most of those who recall her presence.</p>

<p>It is difficult to write of the things that belong
to the Spirit, and Dr. Elsie’s own reserve on these
matters was not often broken. She had been reared
in a God-fearing household, and surrounded from
her earliest years with the atmosphere of an intensely
devout home. That she tried all things,
and approved them to her own conscience, was
natural to her character. Certain doctrines and
formulas found no acceptance with her. Man was
created in God’s image, and the Almighty did not
desire that His creatures should despise or underrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the work of His Hand. The attitude of regarding
the world as a desert, and human beings as miserable
sinners incapable of rendering the highest
service, never commended itself to her eminently
just mind. Such difficulties of belief as she may
have experienced in early years lay in the relations
of the created to the Creator of all that is divine in
man. Till she had convinced herself that a reasonable
service was asked for and would be accepted,
her mind was not completely at rest. In her correspondence
with her father, both in Glasgow and
London, her interest was always living and vital
in the things which belonged to the kingdom of
heaven within. She wandered from church to
church in both places. Oblivious of all distinctions
she would take her prayer book and go for ‘music’
to the Episcopal Church, or attend the undenominational
meetings connected with the Y.W.C.A.
Often she found herself most interested in the
ministry of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Hunter, who subsequently
left Glasgow for London. There are many shrewd
comments on other ministers, on the ‘Declaratory
Acts,’ then agitating the Free Church. She thought
the Westminster Confession should either be
accepted or rejected, and that the position was made
no simpler by ‘declarations.’ In London she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
attended the English Church almost exclusively,
listening to the many remarkable teachers who
in the Nineties occupied the pulpits of the Anglican
Church. It was not till after her father’s death
that she came to rest entirely in the ministry of the
Church of Scotland, and found in the teaching and
friendship of Dr. Wallace Williamson that which
gave her the vital faith which inspired her life and
work, and carried her at last triumphantly through
the swellings of Jordan.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles’ lay in the centre of her healing mission,
and her alert active figure was a familiar sight, as
the little congregation gathered for the daily service.
When the kirk skailed in the fading light of the
short days, the westering sun on the windows would
often fall on the fair hair and bright face of her
whose day had been spent in ministering work.
On these occasions she never talked of her work.
If she was joined by a friend, Dr. Elsie waited to
see what was the pressing thought in the mind of
her companion, and into that she at once poured
her whole sympathy. Few ever walked west with
her to her home without feeling in an atmosphere
of high and chivalrous enterprise. Thus in an
ordered round passed the days and years, drawing
ever nearer to the unknown destiny, when that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
which was to try the reins and the hearts of many
nations was to come upon the world. When that
storm burst, Elsie Inglis was among those whose
lamp was burning, and whose heart was steadfast
and prepared for the things which were coming on
the earth.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> year of the war coincided with that period
in the life of Dr. Inglis when she was fully qualified
for the great part she was to play among the armies
of the Allied nations.</p>

<p>It is now admitted that this country was unprepared
for war, and incredulous as to the German
menace. The services of women have now attained
so high a value in the State that it is difficult to
recast their condition in 1914.</p>

<p>In politics there had been a succession of efforts
to obtain their enfranchisement. Each effort had
been marked by a stronger manifestation in their
favour in the country, and the growing force of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
movement, coupled with the unrest in Ireland, had
kept all political organisations in a high state of
tension.</p>

<p>It has been shown how fully organised were
all the Women Suffrage societies. Committees,
organisers, adherents, and speakers were at work,
and in the highest state of efficiency. Women
linked by a common cause had learnt how to work
together. The best brains in their midst were put
at the service of the Suffrage, and they had watched
in the political arena where to expect support, and
who could be trusted among the leaders of all
parties. No shrewder or more experienced body
of politicians were to be found in the country
than those women drawn from all classes, in all
social, professional, and industrial spheres, who
acknowledged Mrs. Fawcett as their leader, and
trusted no one party, sect, or politician in the year
1914.</p>

<p>When the war caused a truce to be pronounced
in all questions of acute political difference, the
unenfranchised people realised that this might
mean the failure of their hopes for an indefinite
time. They never foresaw that, for the second
time within a century, emancipation was to be
bought by the life blood of a generation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The truce made no difference to any section of
the Suffrage party. It was accepted by the whole
people. War found both men and women unprepared,
but the path of glory was clear for the
men. A great army must be formed in defence
of national liberty. The army was mobilised.
It would have been well had the strength of the
women been mobilised in the same hour. Their
long claim for the rights of citizenship made
them keenly alive and responsive to the call of
national service.</p>

<p>War and its consequences had for many years
been uppermost in their thoughts. In the struggle
for emancipation, the great argument they had had
to face among the rapidly decreasing anti-party,
was the one that women could take no part in war,
and, as all Government rested ultimately on brute
force, women could not fight, and therefore must
not vote.</p>

<p>In countering this outlook, women had watched
what war meant all over the world, wherever it
took place. With the use of scientific weapons of
destruction, with the development of scientific
methods of healing, with all that went to the maintenance
of armies in the field, and the support of
populations at home, women had some vision in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
what manner they would be needed if war ever came
to this country.</p>

<p>The misfortune of such a controversy as that of
the ‘Rights of Women’ is that it necessarily means
the opposition has to prove a negative proposition&mdash;a
most sterilising process. Political parties were
so anxious to prove that women were incapable of
citizenship, that the whole community got into a
pernicious habit of mind. Women were underrated
in every sphere of industry or scientific
knowledge. Their sense of incapacity and irresponsibility
was encouraged, and when they turned
militant under such treatment, they were only
voted a nuisance which it was impossible to totally
exterminate.</p>

<p>Those who watched the gathering war clouds,
and the decline of their Parliamentary hopes, did
not realise that, in the overruling providence of
God, the devastating war among nations was to
open a new era for women. They were no longer
to be held cheap, as irresponsibles&mdash;mere clogs on
the machinery of the State. They were to be called
on to take the place of men who were dying by the
thousand for their homes, fighting against the
doctrine that military force is the only true Government
in a Christian world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>After mobilisation, military authorities had to
make provision for the wounded. We can remember
the early sensation of seeing buildings raised for
other purposes taken over for hospitals. Since the
Crimea, women as nurses at the base were institutions
understood of all men. In the vast camps
which sprang up at the commencement of the war,
women modestly thought they might be usefully
employed as cooks. The idea shocked the War
Office till it rocked to its foundations. A few
adventurous women started laundries for officers,
and others for the men. They did it on their own,
and in peril of their beneficent soap suds, being
ordered to a region where they would be out of
sight, and out of any seasonable service, to the
vermin-ridden camps.</p>

<p>The Suffrage organisations, staffed and equipped
with able practical women Jacks of all trades, in
their midst, put themselves at the call of national
service, but were headed back from all enterprises.
It had been ordained that women could not fight,
and therefore they were of no use in war time. A
few persisted in trying to find openings for service.
Among these were Dr. Inglis. It is one thing to
offer to be useful without any particular qualification;
it is another to have professional knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to give, and the medical women were strong in the
conviction that they had their hard-won science
and skill to offer.</p>

<p>Those who have read the preceding pages will
realise that Dr. Inglis carried into this offer a perfect
knowledge how women doctors were regarded by
the community, and she knew political departments
too well to believe that the War Office would have
a more enlightened outlook. In the past she had
said in choosing her profession that she liked
‘pioneer work,’ and she was to be the pioneer woman
doctor who, with the aid of Suffrage societies,
founded and led the Scottish Women’s Hospitals
to the healing of many races.</p>

<p>After bringing the story of Dr. Inglis to this
point, it is easy to imagine the working of her
fertile brain, and her sense of vital energy, in the
opening weeks of the war. What material for
instant action she had at hand, she used. She had
helped to form a detachment of the V.A.D. when
the idea of this once despised and now greatly
desired body began to take shape. Before the war
men spoke slightingly of its object, and it was much
depreciated. Dr. Inglis saw all the possibilities
which lay in the voluntary aid offer. Dr. Inglis
was in Edinburgh at the commencement of the war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and the 6th Edinburgh V.A.D., of which she was
commandant, was at once mobilised. For several
weeks she worked hard at their training. She
gave up the principal rooms in her house for a
depot for the outfit of Cargilfield as an auxiliary
hospital. The hospital was not accepted. If it
had been, and Dr. Inglis put in charge of it, the
wider work of her life might never have had its
fulfilment. Dr. Inglis from the first advocated
that the V.A.D. should be used as probationers
in military hospitals, and the orderlies who served
in her units were chiefly drawn from this body.</p>

<p>In September she went to London to put her
views before the National Union and the War Office,
and to offer the services of herself and women
colleagues. Miss Mair expresses the thoughts
which were dominating her mind. ‘To her it
seemed wicked that women with power to wield
the surgeon’s knife in the mitigation of suffering
and with knowledge to diagnose and cure, should be
withheld from serving the sick and wounded.’</p>

<p>Her love for the wounded and suffering gave her
a clear vision as to what lay before the armies of the
Allies. ‘At the root of all her strenuous work of
the last three years,’ says her sister, ‘was the
impelling force of her sympathy with the wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
men. This feeling amounted at times to almost
agony. Only once did she allow herself to show
this innermost feeling. This was at the root of
her passionate yearning to get with her unit to
Mesopotamia during the early months of 1916. “I
cannot bear to think of them, <em>our Boys</em>.” To the
woman’s heart within her the wounded men of all
nations made the same irresistible appeal.’</p>

<p>In that spirit she approached a departmental
chief. Official reserve at last gave way, and the
historic sentence was uttered&mdash;‘My good lady, go
home and sit still.’ In that utterance lay the
germ of that inspiration which was to carry the
Red Cross and the Scottish women among many
nations, kindreds, and tongues.</p>

<p>It is easy to picture the scene. The overworked
red-tape-bound official: the little figure of the
woman with the smile, and the ready answer,
before him. There is a story that, while a town in
Serbia was under bombardment, Dr. Inglis was also
in it with some of her hospital work. She sought
an official in his quarters, as she desired certain
things for her hospital. The noise of the firing was
loud, and shells were flying around. Dr. Inglis
seemed oblivious of any sound save her own voice,
and she requested of an under officer an interview<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
with his chief. The official had at last to confess
that his superior was hiding in the cellar till the
calamity of shell-fire was overpast. In much the
same condition was the local War Office official
when confronted with Dr. Inglis and her practical
importunity. No doubt she saw it was useless
to continue her offers of service. Mrs. Fawcett
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Nearly all the memorial notices of her have recorded
the fact that at the beginning of her work in 1914 the
War Office refused her official recognition. The recognition
so stupidly refused by her own country was
joyfully and gratefully given by the French and later
the Serbian A.M.S. and Red Cross.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She went home to her family, who so often had
inspired her to good work, and as she sat and talked
over the war and her plans with one of her nieces,
she suddenly said, ‘I know what we will do! We
will have a unit of our own.’</p>

<p>The ‘We’ referred to that close-knit body of
women with whom she had worked for a common
cause, and she knew at once that ‘We’ would
work with her and in her for the accomplishment
of this ideal which so rapidly took shape in her
teeming brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>She was never left alone in any part of her life’s
work. Her personality knit not only her family
to her in the closest bonds of love, but she had
devoted friends among those who did not see eye
to eye with her in the common cause. She never
loved them the less for disagreeing with her, and
though their indifference to her views might at
times obscure her belief in their mental calibre, it
never interfered with the mutual affections of all.
She did not leave these friends out of her scheme
when it began to take shape.</p>

<p>The Edinburgh Suffrage offices, no longer needed
for propaganda and organisation work, became the
headquarters of the Scottish Women’s Hospitals,
and the enlarged committee, chiefly of Dr. Inglis’
personal friends, began its work under the steam-hammer
of her energy. Miss Mair may again be
quoted.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘Well do I recall the first suggestion that passed
between us on the subject of directing the energies of
our Suffrage Societies to the starting of a hospital.
Let us gather a few hundred pounds, and then appeal
to the public, was the decision of our ever courageous
Dr. Elsie, and from that moment she never swerved
in her purpose. Some of us gasped when she announced
that the sum of <abbr title="50,000 pounds">£50,000</abbr> must speedily be advertised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
for. Some timid souls advised the naming of a smaller
amount as our goal. With unerring perception, our
leader refused to lower the standard, and abundantly
has she been proved right! Not <abbr title="50,000, pounds">£50,000,</abbr> but over
<abbr title="200,000 pounds">£200,000</abbr> have rewarded her faith and her hope.</p>

<p>‘This quick perception was one of the greatest
of her gifts, and it was with perfect simplicity she
stated to me once that when on rare occasions she
had yielded her own conviction to pressure from
others, the result had been unfortunate. There was
not an ounce of vanity in her composition. She was
merely stating a simple fact. Her outlook was both
wide and direct. She saw the object aimed at, and
she marched straight on. If, on the road, some
obstacles had to be not exactly ruthlessly, but very
firmly brushed aside, her strength of purpose was in
the end a blessing to all concerned. Strength combined
with sweetness&mdash;with a wholesome dash of
humour thrown in&mdash;in my mind sums up her character.
What that strength did for agonised Serbia
only the grateful Serbs can fully tell.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A letter written in October of this year to Mrs.
Fawcett tells of the rapid formation of the hospital
idea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date">
‘<span class="smcap">8 Walker Street</span>,<br />
<span class="in_a_bit1">‘<i><abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 9, 1914</i>.</span>
</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Fawcett</span>,&mdash;I wrote to you from the
office this morning, but I want to point out a little
more fully what the Committee felt about the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of the hospitals. We felt that our original scheme
was growing very quickly into something very big&mdash;much
bigger than anything we had thought of at the
beginning&mdash;and we felt that if the hospitals were
called by a non-committal name it would be much
easier to get all men and women to help. The scheme
is <em>of course</em> a National Union scheme, and that fact
the Scottish Federation will never lose sight of, or
attempt to disguise. The National Union will be at
the head of all our appeals, and press notices, and
paper.</p>

<p>‘But&mdash;if you could reverse the position, and imagine
for a moment that the Anti-Suffrage Society had
thought of organising all these skilled women for
service, you can quite see that many more neutrals,
and a great many suffragists would have been ready
to help if they sent their subscriptions to the “Scottish
Women’s Hospital for Foreign Service,” than if they
had to send to the Anti-Suffrage League Hospital.</p>

<p>‘We were convinced that the more women we could
get to help, the greater would be the gain to the
woman’s movement.</p>

<p>‘For we have hit upon a really splendid scheme.
When Mrs. Laurie and I went to see Sir George Beatson&mdash;the
head of the Scottish Red Cross, in Glasgow&mdash;he
said at once: “Our War Office will have nothing
to say to you,” and then he added, “yet there is no
knowing what they may do before the end of the
war.”</p>

<p>‘You see, we get these expert women doctors, nurses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and ambulance workers organised. We send our units
wherever they are wanted. Once these units are out,
the work is bound to grow. The need is there, and
too terrible to allow any haggling about who does the
work. If we have a thoroughly good organisation here,
we can send out more and more units, or strengthen
those already out. We can add motor ambulances,
organise rest stations on the lines of communication,
and so on. It will all depend on how well we are supplied
with funds and brains at our base. Each unit ought to
be carefully chosen, and the very best women doctors
must go out with them. I wrote this morning to the
Registered Medical Women’s Association in London,
and asked them to help us, and offered to address a
meeting when I come up for your meeting. Next
week a special meeting of the Scottish Medical
Women’s Association is being called to discuss the
question.</p>

<p>‘From the very beginning we must make it clear
that our hospitals are as well-equipped and well-manned
as any in the field, more economical (easy!),
and thoroughly efficient.</p>

<p>‘I cannot think of anything more calculated to bring
home to men the fact that women <em>can help</em> intelligently
in any kind of work. So much of our work is
done where they cannot see it. They’ll see every
bit of this.</p>

<p>‘The fates seem to be fighting for us! Sometimes
schemes do float off with the most extraordinary ease.
The Belgian Consul here is Professor Sarolea&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
editor of <cite>Everyman</cite>. He grasped at the help we offered,
and has written off to several influential people. And
then yesterday morning he wrote saying that his brother
Dr. Leon Sarolea, would come and “work under” us.
He is an M.P., a man of considerable influence. So
you can see the Belgian Hospital will have everything
in its favour.</p>

<p>‘Then Mr. Seton Watson, who has devoted his life
to the Balkan States, has taken up the Servian Unit.
He puts himself “entirely at our service.” He knows
all the powers that be in Servia.</p>

<p>‘Two people in the Press have offered to help.</p>

<p>‘The money is the thing now. It must not be wasted,
but we must have lots.</p>

<p>‘And as the work grows do let’s keep it <em>together</em>, so
that, however many hospitals we send out, they all
shall be run on the same lines, and wherever people
see the Union Jack with the red, white and green
flag below it, they’ll know it means efficiency and
kindness and intelligence.</p>

<p>‘I wanted the Executive, for this reason, to call the
hospitals “British Women’s Hospitals for Foreign
Service,” but of course it was their own idea, and one
understood the desire to call it “Scottish”; but if
there is a splendid response from England and from
other federations, that will have to be reconsidered,
<em>I</em> think. The great thing is to do the thing well, and
do it as <em>one</em> scheme.</p>

<p>‘I do hope you’ll approve of all this. I am marking
this letter “Private,” because it isn’t an official letter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
but just what I think&mdash;to you, my Chief. But you
can show it to anybody you like&mdash;as that.</p>

<p>‘I can think of nothing except these “Units” just
now! And when one hears of the awful need, one
can hardly sit still till they are ready. Professor
Sarolea simply made one’s heart bleed. He is just
back from Belgium. He said, “You talk of distress
from the war here. You simply know nothing about
it.”&mdash;Ever yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="signed">
‘<span class="smcap">Elsie Maud Inglis</span>.’
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In October 1914 the scheme was finally adopted
by the Scottish Federation, and the name of Scottish
Women’s Hospitals was chosen.</p>

<p>At the same meeting the committee decided to
send Dr. Inglis to London to explain the plan to
the National Union, and to speak at a meeting in
the Kingsway Hall, on ‘What women could do to
help in the war.’ At that meeting she was authorised
to speak on the plans of the S.W.H. The
N.U.W.S.S. adopted the plan of campaign on
15th October, and the London society was soon
taking up the work of procuring money to start new
units, and to send Dr. Inglis out on her last enterprise,
with a unit fully equipped to work with the
Serbian army, then fighting on the Bulgarian front.</p>

<p>The use she made of individuals is well illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
by Miss Burke. She was ‘found’ by Dr. Inglis
in the office of the London Society, and sent forth
to speak and fill the Treasury chest of the S.W.H.
It is written in the records of that work how
wonderfully Miss Burke influenced her countrymen
in America, and how nobly, through her efforts,
they have aided ‘the great adventure.’</p>

</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Lady Frances</span>,&mdash;Certainly I am one of
Dr. Elsie’s children. It was largely due to her intuition
and clear judgment of character that my feet
were placed in the path which led to my reaching my
maximum efficiency as a hospital worker and a member
of the Scottish Women’s Hospitals. I first met Dr.
Elsie after I had been the Secretary of the London
Committee for about a month. There was no question
of meeting a “stranger”; her kindly eyes smiled
straight into mine.</p>

<p>‘Was I young and rather shy? Well, the best way
to encourage me was to give me responsibility.</p>

<p>‘“Do you speak French?”</p>

<p>‘“Yes.”</p>

<p>‘“Very well, go and write me a letter to General
de Torcy, telling him we accept the building he has
offered at Troyes.”</p>

<p>‘Some one hazarded the suggestion that the letter
should be passed on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>‘“Nonsense,” replied Dr. Elsie, “I know the type.
That girl probably speaks six languages. If she says
she speaks French, she does.”</p>

<p>‘She practically signed the letter I wrote her without
reading it. Doubtless all the time I was with her I
was under her keen scrutiny, and when finally, after
arranging a meeting for her at Oxford, which she
found impossible to take, owing to her sudden decision
to leave for Serbia, she had already judged me, and
without hesitation she told me to go to Oxford and
speak myself. I have wondered often whether any
one else would have sent a young and unknown speaker&mdash;it
needed Dr. Elsie’s knowledge of human character
and rapid energetic method of making decisions.</p>

<p>‘It would be difficult for we young ones of the
Scottish Women’s Hospitals to analyse our feelings
towards Dr. Elsie. A wave of her hand in passing
meant much to us.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Space utterly forbids our following the fortunes
of the Scottish Women’s Hospitals as they went
forth one by one to France, to Belgium, to
Serbia, to Corsica, and Russia. That history will
have some day to be written. It is only possible
in this memoir to speak of their work in
relation to their founder and leader. ‘Not I,
but my unit,’ was her dying watchword, and
when the work of her unit is reviewed, it is
obvious how they carried with them, as an oriflamme,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the inspiration of unselfish devotion set
them by Dr. Inglis.</p>

<p>Besides going into all the detailed work of the
hospital equipment, Dr. Inglis found time to continue
her work of speaking for the cause of the
hospitals. We find her addressing her old friends:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I have the happiest recollection of Dr.&nbsp;I. addressing
a small meeting of the W.&nbsp;L. Association here. It was
one of her first meetings to raise money. She told us
how she wanted to go to Serbia. She was so convincing,
but with all my faith in her, I never thought
she <em>would</em> get there! That, and much more she did&mdash;a
lesson in faith.</p>

<p>‘She looked round the little gathering in the Good
Templar Hall and said, “I suppose nobody here could
lend me a yacht?” She did get her ship there.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To one of her workers in this time, she said, ‘My
dear, we shall live all our lives in the shadow of
war.’ The one to whom she spoke says, ‘A cold
chill struck my heart. Did she feel it, and know
that never again would things be as they were?’</p>

<p>At the close of 1914 Dr. Inglis went to France
to see the Scottish Women’s Hospital established
and working under the French Red Cross at Royaumont.
It was probably on her way back that she
went to Paris on business connected with Royaumont.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
She went into Notre Dame, and chose a
seat in a part of the cathedral where she could feel
alone. She there had an experience which she
afterwards told to Mrs. M‘Laren. As she sat there
she had a strong feeling that some one was behind
her. She resisted the impulse to turn round,
thinking it was some one who like herself wanted
to be quiet! The feeling grew so strong at last,
that she involuntarily turned round. There was
no one near her, but for the first time she realised
she was sitting in front of a statue of Joan of Arc.
To her it appeared as if the statue was instinct with
life. She added: ‘Wasn’t it curious?’ Then
later she said, ‘I would like to know what Joan
was wanting to say to me!’ I often think of the
natural way which she told me of the experience,
and the <em>practical</em> conclusion of wishing to know
what Joan wanted. Once again she referred to the
incident, before going to Russia. I see her expression
now, just for a moment forgetting everything
else, keen, concentrated, and her humorous smile, as
she said, ‘You know I would like awfully to know
what Joan was trying to say to me.’</p>

<p>Elsie Inglis was not the first, nor will she be the
last woman who has found help in the story of the
Maid of Orleans, when the causes dear to the hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of nations are at stake. It is easy to hear the words
that would pass between these two leaders in the
time of their country’s warfare. The graven figure
of Joan was instinct with life, from the undying
love of race and country, which flowed back to her
from the woman who was as ready to dedicate to
her country her self-forgetting devotion, as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jeanne
d’Arc</span> had been in her day. Both, in their day
and generation, had heard&mdash;</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dearest Amy</span>,&mdash;Many, many happy Christmases
to you, dear, and to all the others. Everything is
splendid here now, and if the General from headquarters
would only come and inspect us, we could
begin. The wards are perfect. I only wish you could
see them with their red bedcovers, and little tables.
There are four wards, and we have called them Blanche
of Castille (the woman who really started the building
of this place, the mother of Louis <abbr title="9"><span class="smcap">IX.</span></abbr>, the Founder,
as he is called), Queen Margaret of Scotland, Joan of
Arc, and Millicent Fawcett. Now, don’t you think
that is rather nice! The Abbaye itself is a wonderful
place. It has beautiful architecture, and is placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in delightful woods. One wants to spend hours
exploring it, instead of which we have all been working
like galley slaves getting the hospital in order. The
equipment has come out practically all right. There
are no thermometers and no sandbags. I feel they’ll
turn up. Yesterday, I was told there were no tooth-brushes
and no nail-brushes, but they appeared.
After all the fuss, you can imagine our feelings when
the “Director,” an official of the French Red Cross,
who has to live here with us, told us French soldiers
don’t want tooth-brushes!</p>

<p>‘Our first visitors were three French officers, whom
we took for the inspecting general, and treated with
grovelling deference, till we found they knew nothing
about it, and were much more interested in the tapestry
in the proprietor’s house than in our instruments.
However, they were very nice, and said we were
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien meublé</i>.</p>

<p>‘Once we had all been on tenterhooks all day about
the inspection. Suddenly, a man poked his head
round the door of the doctor’s sitting-room and said,
“The General.” In one flash every doctor was out
of the room and into her bedroom for her uniform coat,
and I was left sitting. I got up, and wandered downstairs,
when an excited orderly dashed past, singing,
“Nothing but two British officers!” Another time
we were routed out from breakfast by the cry of “The
General,” but this time it turned out to be a French
regiment, whose officers had been moved by curiosity to
come round by here. The General has not arrived yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>‘We have had to get a new boiler in the kitchen, new
taps and lavatories, and electric light, an absolute
necessity in this huge place, and all the theatre sinks.
We certainly are no longer a <em>mobile</em> hospital, but as
we are twelve miles from the point from which the
wounded are distributed (I am getting very discreet
about names since a telegram of mine was censored),
we shall probably be as useful here as anywhere.
They even think we may get English Tommies.</p>

<p>‘You have no idea of the conditions to which the
units came out, and they have behaved like perfect
bricks. The place was like an ice hole: there were
no fires, no hot water, no furniture, not even blankets,
and the equipment did not arrive for five days. They
have scrubbed the whole place out themselves, as
if they were born housemaids; put up the beds,
stuffed the mattresses, and done everything. Really,
I am proud of them! They stick at absolutely nothing,
and when Madame came, she said, “What it is to
belong to a practical nation!”</p>

<p>‘We had a service in the ward on Sunday. We are
going to see if they will let us use the little <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis
Chapel. There are two other chapels, one in use,
that we hope the soldiers will go to, and a beautiful
chapel the same style of architecture as the chapel at

<p>Mr. Seton Watson has permitted his article in the
December number of the <cite>New Europe</cite> (1917) to be
reprinted here. His complete knowledge of Serbia
enables him to describe both the work and Dr.
Inglis who undertook the great task set before her.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Elsie Inglis was one of the heroic figures of the war,
one whose memory her many friends will cherish with
pride and confidence&mdash;pride at having been privileged
to work with her, confidence in the race which breeds
such women. This is not the place to tell the full story
of her devotion to many a good cause at home, but the
<cite>New Europe</cite> owes her a debt of special interest and
affection. For in her own person she stood for that
spirit of sympathy and comprehension upon which
intercourse between the nations must be founded, if the
ideal of a New Europe is ever to become a reality.</p>

<p>‘Though her lifework had hitherto lain in utterly
different fields, she saw in a flash the needs of a tragic
situation; and when war came offered all her indomitable
spirit and tireless energy to a cause till recently unknown
and even frowned upon in our country. Like the
Douglas of old, she flung herself where the battle raged
most fiercely&mdash;always claiming and at last obtaining
permission to set up her hospitals where the obstacles
were greatest and the dangers most acute. But
absorbed as she was in her noble task of healing, she
saw beyond it the high national ideal that inspired
the Serbs to endure sufferings unexampled even in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
war, and became an enthusiastic convert to the cause of
Southern Slav unity. To her, as to all true Europeans,
the principle of nationality is not, indeed, the end of all
human wisdom, but the sure foundation upon which
a new and saner internationalism is to be built, and an
inalienable right to which great and small alike are
entitled. Perhaps the fact that she herself came of
a small nation which, like Serbia, has known how to
celebrate its defeats, was not without its share in
determining her sympathies.</p>

<p>‘The full political meaning of her work has not yet
been brought home to her countrymen, and yet what
she has done will live after her. Her achievement in
Serbia itself in 1915 was sufficiently remarkable, but
even that was a mere prelude to her achievement on
the Eastern front. The Serbian Division in Southern
Russia, which the Scottish Women’s Hospitals went
out to help, was not Serbian at all in the <em>ordinary</em> sense
of the word. Its proper name is the Jugoslav Division,
for it was composed entirely of volunteers drawn from
among the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes of Austria-Hungary
who had been taken prisoners by the Russian
army. Thousands of these men enrolled themselves
on the side of the Entente and in the service of Serbia,
in order to fight for the realisation of Southern Slav
independence and unity under the national dynasty
of Kara George. Beyond the ordinary risks of war
they acted in full knowledge that capture by the enemy
would mean the same fate as Austria meted out to the
heroic Italian deputy, Cesare Battisti; and some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
them, left wounded on the battle-field after a retreat,
shot each other to avoid being taken alive. Throughout
the Dobrudja campaign they fought with the most
desperate gallantry against impossible odds, and, owing
to inadequate support during the retreat, their main
body was reduced from 15,000 to 4000. Latterly the
other divisions had been withdrawn to recruit at
Odessa, after sharing the defence of the Rumanian
southern front.</p>

<p>‘To these men in the summer of 1916 Serbia had sent
a certain number of higher officers, but, for equipment
and medical help, they were dependent upon what the
Russians could spare from their own almost unlimited
needs. At the worst hour Dr. Inglis and her unit came
to the help of the Jugoslavs, shared their privations and
misfortunes, and spared no effort in their cause.</p>

<p>‘History will record the name of Elsie Inglis, like that
of Lady Paget, as pre-eminent among that band of
women who have redeemed for all time the honour of
Britain in the Balkans. Among the Serbs it is already
assuming an almost legendary quality. To us it will
serve to remind us that Florence Nightingale will never
be without successors among us. And in particular,
every true Scotsman will cherish her memory, every
believer in the cause for which she gave her life will gain
fresh courage from her example.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dr. Inglis</span> remained at home directing the many
operations necessary to ensure the proper equipment
of the units, and the difficult task of getting
them conveyed overseas. From the beginning, till
her return with her unit serving with the Serbian
army in Russia, she had the sustaining co-operation
both of the Admiralty and the Foreign Office. In
the many complications surrounding the history of
the hospitals with the Allied armies, the Scottish
women owed very much to both Secretaries of State
for Foreign Affairs, and very particularly to Lord
Robert Cecil in his department of the Foreign Office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not easy to get the scheme of hospitals
staffed entirely by women, serving abroad with
armies fighting the common and unscrupulous
foe, accepted by those in authority. The Foreign
Office was responsible for the safety of these British
outpost hospitals, and they knew well the dangers
and privations to which the devoted pioneer band
of women would be exposed. They made many
stipulations with Dr. Inglis, which she accepted,
and abided by as long as her work was not hindered.
No care or diplomatic work was spared, and if
at the end of their service in Russia the safety of
the unit was a matter of grave anxiety to the
Foreign Office, it had never cause to be ashamed of
the way this country’s honour and good faith was
upheld by the hospitals under the British flag,
amid the chaotic sufferings of the Russian people.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1915 Dr. Eleanor Soltau, who
was in charge of the First Serbian Unit, became ill
with diphtheria in the midst of the typhus epidemic
which was devastating the Serbian people. The
Serbian Minister writes of that time:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘They were the first to go to the help of Serbia when
the Austrians, after they were defeated, besides 60,000
prisoners, also left behind them epidemics in all the
districts which they had invaded. The Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
women turned up their sleeves, so to speak, at the
railways station itself, and went straight to typhus and
typhoid-stricken patients, who were pitifully dying in
the crowded hospitals.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Colonel Hunter, A.M.S., wrote after her death:
‘It was my privilege and happiness to see much of
her work in Serbia when I was officer in charge
of the corps of R.A.M.C. officers sent out by the
W.O. to deal with the raging epidemic of typhus
and famine fevers then devastating the land. I
have never met with any one who gave me so deep
an impression of singlemindedness, gentleheartedness,
clear and purposeful vision, wise judgment,
and absolutely fearless disposition.... No more
lovable personality than hers, or more devoted and
courageous body of women, ever set out to help
effectively a people in dire distress than the S.W.H.,’
which she organised and sent out, and afterwards
took personal charge of in Serbia in 1915. Amidst
the most trying conditions she, or they, never
faltered in courage or endurance. Under her wise
and gentle leadership difficulties seemed only to
stir to further endeavour, more extended work,
and greater endurance of hardship. Captain Ralph
Glyn writes from France:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘I see you went to the funeral of that wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
person, Dr. Elsie Inglis. I shall never forget arriving
where that S.W. unit was in the midst of the typhus in
Serbia, and finding her and all her people so “clean”
and obviously ready for anything.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Serbian nation lost no time in commemorating
her services to them. At Mladenovatz they
built a beautiful fountain close to the camp hospital.
On 7th October 1915 it was formally opened with a
religious service according to the rites of the Greek
Church. Dr. Inglis turned on the water, which was
to flow through the coming years in grateful
memory of the good work done by the Scottish
Women’s Hospitals.</p>

<p><cite>The Englishwoman</cite>, April and June 1916, has
two articles written by Dr. Inglis, under the title
‘The Tragedy of Serbia.’ The literary power of
her narrative makes one regret that she did not
live to give a consecutive account of all she passed
through in the countries in which she suffered with
the peoples:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘When we reached Serbia in May 1915, she was lying
in sunshine. Two storms had raged over her during
the preceding months&mdash;the Austrian invasion and the
terrific typhus epidemic. In our safe little island we
can hardly realise what either meant. At the end of
1914, the Austrian Empire hurled its “punitive expedition”
across the Danube&mdash;a punitive expedition
that ended in the condign punishment of the invader.
They left behind them a worse foe than themselves,
and the typhus, which began in the hospitals they left
so scandalously filthy and overcrowded, swept over the
land.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Inglis describes ‘the long peaceful summer,’
with its hopes of an advance to their aid on the part
of the Allies. The Serbs were conscious the ‘Great
Powers’ owed them much, for how often we heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the words, ‘We are the only one, as yet, who has
beaten our enemy.’</p>

<p>‘Not till September did any real sense of danger
trouble them. Then the clouds rolled up black
and threatening on the horizon&mdash;Bulgaria arming,
and a hundred thousand Germans massing on the
northern frontier. They began to draw off the
main part of their army from the Danube towards
the east, to meet their old enemies. The Powers
refused to let them attack, and they waited till
the Bulgarian mobilisation was complete. The
Allies discounted the attack from the north; aeroplanes
had been out, and “there are no Germans
there.” There are no signs whatever of any military
movements, so said the wiseacres. The only
troops there are untrained Austrian levies, which
the Serbs ought to be able to deal with themselves,
if they are up to their form last year.</p>

<p>‘Then the storm broke. The 100,000 Germans
appeared on the northern frontier. The Bulgars
invaded from the east, the Greeks did not come in,
and the Austrians poured in from the west. The
Serbian army shortened the enormous line they had
to defend, but they could not stand against the
long-distance German guns, and so began the
retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>‘“What is coming to Serbia?” said a Serb to me,
“we cannot think.” And then, hopefully, “But
God is great and powerful, and our Allies are great
and powerful too.” Strong men could hardly speak
of the disaster without breaking down. They
looked at one so eagerly. “When are your men
coming up? They must come soon.” “We must
give our people two months,” the experts among us
answered, “to bring up the heavy artillery. We
thought the Serbs would be able to hold the West
Morava Valley.” “It is too hilly for the German
artillery to be of any use,” they said.’</p>

<p>Dr. Inglis goes on to relate how all the calculations
were wrong, how the Austrian force came down that
very valley. The Serbs were caught in a trap, and
that 160,000 of their gallant little army escaped
was a wonderful feat. ‘That they are already
keen to take the field again is but one more
proof of the extraordinary recuperative power of
the nation.’</p>

<p>Dr. Elsie gives an account of the typhus epidemic.
The first unit under Dr. Soltau, in 1914, was able
at Kragujevatz to do excellent work for the Serbian
army after its victories, and it was only evacuated
owing to the retreat in October 1915. The unit
had only been a fortnight out when the committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
got from it a telegram, ‘dire necessity’ for more
doctors and nurses. The word <em>dire</em> was used,
hoping it would pass unnoticed by the censor, for
the authorities did not wish the state of Serbia
from typhus to be generally known. We shall
never know what the death-rate was during the
epidemic; but of the 425 Serbian doctors, 125 died
of the disease, and two-thirds of the remainder
had it.</p>

<p>The Scottish Committee hastened out supplies
and staff.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘For three months the epidemic raged, and all women
may ever be proud of the way those women worked.
It was like a long-drawn-out battle, and not one of them
played the coward. Not one of them asked to come
away. There were three deaths and nine cases of illness
among the unit; and may we not truly claim that
those three women who died gave their lives for the
great cause for which our country stands to-day as much
as any man in the trenches.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Inglis speaks of the full share of work taken
by other British units&mdash;Lady Paget’s Hospital
at Skopio, ‘magnificently organised’; The Red
Cross under Dr. Banks ‘took more than its share
of the burden’; and how Dr. Ryan of the American
hospital asserted that Serbia would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
wiped out but for the work of the Foreign
Missions.</p>

<p>Miss Holme tells of some of her experiences with
her leader:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date">
‘<span class="smcap">Kragujevatz.</span>
</p>

<p>‘One day, Dr. Elsie Inglis took me out shopping
with her, and we wanted a great many things for our
hospital in the way of drugs, etc., and we also wanted
more than anything else some medical scales for weighing
drugs. While we were in the shop Dr. Inglis saw
hanging up in it three pairs of these scales. So she
asked the man, in her most persuasive manner, if he
would sell her a pair of these scales for our hospital use.
He explained at length that he used all the scales, and
was sorry that he could not possibly sell them. So Dr.
Inglis bought some more things&mdash;in fact, we stayed in
the shop for about an hour buying things to the amount
of <abbr title="10 pounds">£10</abbr>, and between each of the different articles
purchased, she would again revert to the scales and say,
“You know it is for <em>your</em> men that we want them,”
until at last the man&mdash;exhausted by his refusals&mdash;took
down the scales and presented them to her.
When she asked “How much are they?” he made
a bow, and said it would be a pleasure to give them
to her.</p>

<p>‘When we were taken prisoners, and had been so for
some time, and before we were liberated, the German
Command came bringing a paper which they commanded
Dr. Inglis to sign. The purport of the paper was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
statement which declared that the British prisoners
had been well treated in the hands of the Germans,
and was already signed by two men who were heads
of other British units. Dr. Inglis said, “Why should
I sign this paper? I do not know if all the prisoners
are being well treated by you, therefore I decline to
sign it.” To which the German authorities replied,
“You must sign it.” Dr. Inglis then said, “Well,
make me,” and that was the end of that incident&mdash;she
never did sign it.</p>

<p>‘So convinced were some of the people belonging
to the Scottish Women’s unit that the British forces
were coming to the aid of their Serbian ally, that long
after they were taken prisoners they thought, each
time they heard a gun from a different quarter, that
their liberators were close at hand. So much so indeed,
that three of the members of the unit begged that in
the event of the unit being sent home they might be
allowed to stay behind in Serbia with the Serbs, to help
the Serbian Red Cross. Dr. Inglis <em>unofficially</em> consented
to this, and with the help of the Serbian Red Cross
these three people in question adjourned to a village
hard by which was about a mile from the hospital,
three days before the unit had orders to move. No
one except Dr. Inglis and three other people of the unit
knew where these three members were living. However,
the date of the departure was changed, and the
unit was told they were to wait another twenty
days. This made it impossible for these three people
to appear again with the unit. They continued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
live at the little house which sheltered them. Suddenly
one afternoon one of the members of the unit went to
ask at the German Command if there were any letters
for the unit. At this interview, which took place about
three o’clock in the afternoon, the person was informed
that the whole unit was to leave that night at 7.30.
Dr. Inglis sent the person who received this command
to tell the three people in the cottage to get ready, and
that they must go, she thought. But the messenger
only said, “We have had orders that the unit is to go
at 7.30 to-night,” but did not say that Dr. Inglis had
sent an order for the three people to get ready, so they
did nothing but simply went to bed at ten o’clock,
thinking the unit had already started. It was a wintry
night, snowing heavily, and not a night that one would
have sent out a dog!</p>

<p>‘At about half-past ten a knock came to the window,
and Dr. Inglis’ voice was heard saying, “You have to
come at once to the train. I am here with an armed
guard!” (All the rest of the unit had been at the
station for some hours, but the train was not allowed
to start until every one was there.) So Dr. Inglis came
herself for us. It was difficult to get her to enter the
house, and naturally she seemed rather ruffled, having
had to come more than a mile in the deep snow, as she
was the only person who knew anything about us. One
of the party said, “Are you really cross, or are you
pretending because the armed guard understands
English?” She gave her queer little smile, and said,
“No, I am not pretending.” The whole party tramped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
through the snow to the station, and on the way she
told them she was afraid that she had smashed somebody’s
window, having knocked at another cottage
before she found ours in the dark, thinking it was the
one we lived in, for which she was very much chaffed
by her companions, who knew well her views on the
question of militant tactics!</p>

<p>‘The first stages of this journey were made in horse-boxes
with no accommodation whatsoever. Occasionally
the train drew up in the middle of the country, and
anybody who wished to get out had simply to ask the
sentry who guarded the door, to allow them to get out
for a moment.</p>

<p>‘The next night was spent lying on the floor of the
station at Belgrade, the eight sentries and all their
charges all lying on the floor together; the only person
who seemed to be awake was the officer who guarded
the door himself all night. In the morning one was
not allowed to go even to wash one’s hands without a
sentry to come and stand at the door. The next two
days were spent in an ordinary train rather too well
heated with four a side in second-class compartments.
At Vienna all the British units who were being sent
away were formed into a group on the station at
6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, where they awaited the arrival of the American
Consul, guarded all the time by their sentries, who gave
his parole that if the people were allowed to go out of the
station they would return at eight o’clock, the time they
had to leave that town. This was granted. Dr. Inglis
with a party adjourned to a hotel where baths, etc., were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
provided. Other members were allowed to do what they
liked.</p>

<p>‘The unit was detained for eight days at Bludenz,
close to the frontier, for Switzerland. On their arrival
at Zürich they were met by the British Consul-General,
Vice-Consul, and many members of the British Colony,
who gave Dr. Inglis and her unit a very warm-hearted
welcome, bringing quantities of flowers, and doing all
they could to show them kindness and pleasure at their
safe arrival.</p>

<p>‘It is difficult for people who have never been
prisoners to know what the first day’s freedom means.
Everybody had a different expression, and seemed to
have a different outlook on life. But already we could
see our leader was engrossed with plans and busy with
schemes for the future work of the unit.</p>

<p>‘The next day the Consul-General made a speech
in which he told the unit all that had passed during the
last four months, of which they knew nothing.’</p>

<p>‘The boat ought to have left last night, but it did
not even come in till this morning. However, we have
only lost twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>‘It has been a most luxurious journey, except the
bit from Naples here, and that was rather awful, with
spitting men and shut windows, in first-class carriages,
remember. When we got here we immediately ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
baths, but “the boiler was broken.” So, I said, “Well,
then, we must go somewhere else”&mdash;with the result
that we were promised baths in our rooms at once.
That was a nice bath, and then I curled up on the sofa
and went to sleep. Our windows look right on to the
docks, and the blue Mediterranean beyond. It is so
queer to see the red, white, and green flags, and to think
they mean Italy, and not the N.U.W.S.S.!</p>

<p>‘I went out before dinner last night, and strolled
through the quaint streets. The whole population was
out, and most whole-hearted and openly interested in
my uniform.</p>

<p>‘This is a most delightful window, with all the ships
and the colours. There are three men-of-war in, and
half a dozen of the quaintest little boats, which a soldier
told me were “scouts.” I wished I had asked a sailor,
for I had never heard of “scouts.” The soldier I
asked is one of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">bersaglieri</span> with cock’s feathers, a huge
mass of them, in his hat. They all say Italy is certainly
coming into the war. One man on the train to Rome
was coming from Cardiff to sell coal to the Italian
Government. He told us weird stories about German
tricks to get our coal through Spain and other
countries.</p>

<p>‘It was a pleasure seeing Royaumont. It is a <em>huge</em>

the men’s clothes were all perfect.’</p>

<p>‘Well, this is a perfectly lovely place, and the
Serbians are delightful. I am staying with a charming
woman, Madame Milanovitz. She is a Vice-President of
the Serbian Women’s League, formed to help the country
in time of war. I think she wanted to help us because
of all the hospital has done here. Any how, <em>I</em> score&mdash;I
have a beautiful room and everything. She gives me
an early cup of coffee, and for the rest I live with the
unit. Neither she nor I can speak six words of one
another’s languages, but her husband can talk a little
French. Now, she has asked the little Serbian lady
who teaches the unit Serbian, to live with her to interpret.
Anyhow, we are great friends!</p>

<p>‘We have had a busy time since we arrived. The
unit is nursing 550 beds, in three hospitals, having been
sent out to nurse 300 beds. There is first the surgical
hospital, called Reserve No. 3. It was a school, and
is in two blocks with a long courtyard between. I
think we have got it really quite well equipped, with
a fine X-Ray room. The theatre, and the room opposite
where the dressings are done, both very well arranged,
and a great credit to Sister Bozket. The one thing that
troubled me was the floor&mdash;old wood and holes in it,
impossible to sterilise&mdash;but yesterday, Major Protitch,
our Director, said he was going to get cement laid down
in it and the theatre. Then it will be perfect. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
said to Dr. Chesney, “This is the best surgical hospital
in Serbia.” You must not believe that <em>quite</em>, for they
are very good at saying pleasant things here!</p>

<p>‘There are two other hospitals, the typhus one,
No. 6 Reserve, and one for relapsing fever and general
diseases, No. 7 Reserve, both barracks. We have put
most of our strength in No. 6, and it is in good working
order, but No. 7 has had only one doctor, and two day
Sisters and one night, for over 200 beds. Still it is
wonderful what those three women have done. We
have Austrian prisoners as orderlies everywhere, in the
hospitals and in the houses. The conglomeration of
languages is too funny for words&mdash;Serbian, German,
French, English. Sometimes, you have to get an
orderly to translate Serbian into German, and another
to translate the German into French before you can get
at what is wanted. Two words we have all learnt,
<i>dotra</i>, which means “good,” and which these grateful
people use at once if they feel a little better, or are
pleased about anything, and the other is <i>boli</i>, pain&mdash;poor
men!</p>

<p>‘So much for what we <em>have</em> been doing; but the
day before yesterday we got our orders for a new bit
of work. They are forming a disinfecting centre at
Mladanovatz, and Colonel Grustitch, who is the head of
the Medical Service here, wants us to go up there at
once, with our whole fever staff, under canvas. They
are giving us the tents till ours come out. Typhus
is decreasing so much, that No. 6 is to be turned into
a surgical hospital, and there will be only one infectious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
diseases hospital here. I am so pleased at being asked
to do this, for it is part of a big and well thought out
scheme. The surgical hospital is to remain here.
Alice Hutchison goes to Posheravatz also for infectious
diseases. I hope she is at Salonika to-day. She left
Malta last Sunday. We really began to think the
Governor was going to keep her altogether! Her
equipment has all come, and yesterday I sent Mrs.
Haverfield and Mr. Smith up to Posheravatz to choose
the site and pitch the tent.</p>

<p>‘They gave me an awfully exciting bit of news in
Colonel G.’s office yesterday, and that was that five
motor cars were in Serbia, north of Mladanovatz, for
<em>me</em>. Of course, I had wired for six, but you have been
prompt about them. How they got into the north of
Serbia I cannot imagine, unless they were dropped out
of aeroplanes.</p>

<p>‘Really, it is wonderful the work this unit has done
in the most awful stress all through March and April.
We ought to be awfully proud of them. The Serbian
Government gave Dr. Soltau a decoration, and Patsy
Hunter had two medals.</p>

sleep outside under the stars. Such lovely starlight
nights we have here. Dr. Alice Hutchison is head of

Serbia has been at war for three years, four wars in
three years, and the women of the country have kept

<p>As the fever died out, a worse enemy came in.
Serbia was overrun by the Austro-German forces,
and she, with others of her units, was taken prisoner,
as they had decided it was their duty to remain at
their work among the sick and wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the Serbian Minister is quoted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘When the typhus calamity was overcome, the
Scottish women reorganised themselves as tent hospitals
and offered to go as near as possible to the army at the
front. Their camp in the town of Valjevo&mdash;which
suffered most of all from the Austrian invasion&mdash;might
have stood in the middle of England. In Lazarevatz,
shortly before the new Austro-German offensive, they
formed a surgical hospital almost out of nothing, in the
devastated shops and the village inns, and they accomplished
the nursing of hundreds of wounded who poured
in from the battle-field. When it became obvious that
the Serbian army could not resist the combined
Austrians, Germans, Magyars, and Bulgarians, who
were about four times their numbers, the main care
of the Serbian military authorities was what to do
with the hospitals full of wounded, and whom to leave
with the wounded soldiers, who refused to be left to
fall into the hands of the cruel enemy. Then the
Scottish women declared that they were not going to
leave their patients, and that they would stay with
them, whatever the conditions, and whatever might be
expected from the enemy. They remained with the
Serbian wounded as long as they could be of use to
them.</p>

<p>‘We are in the very centre of the storm, and it just
feels exactly like having the rain pouring down, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
wind beating in gusts, and not being able to see for the
water in one’s eyes, and just holding on and saying,
“It cannot last, it is so bad.” These poor little people,
you cannot imagine anything more miserable than they
are. Remember, they have been fighting for years
for their independence, and now it all seems to end.
The whole country is overrun. Germans, Austrians,
Bulgars, and all that is left is this western Morava
Valley, and the country a little south of it. And their
big Allies&mdash;from here it looks as if they are never going
to move. I went into Craijuvo yesterday, in the car,
to see about Dr. MacGregor’s unit. The road was
crowded with refugees pouring away, all their goods
piled on their rickety ox-wagons, little children on the
top, and then bands of soldiers, stragglers from the
army. These men were forming up again, as we passed
back later on. The hospitals are packed with wounded.
We decided we must stand by our hospitals; it was too
awful leaving badly wounded men with no proper care.
Sir Ralph eventually agreed, and we gave everybody
in the units the choice of going or staying. We have
about 115 people in the Scottish unit, and twenty have
gone. Mr. Smith brings up the rear-guard to-day,
with one or two laggards and a wounded English
soldier we have had charge of. Two of our units are
here. Dr. MacGregor has trekked for Novi Bazaar.
It is the starting-place for Montenegro. We all
managed wonderfully in our first “evacuations,” and
saved practically everything, but now it is hopeless.
The bridges are down, and the trucks standing anyhow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
on sidings, and, worst of all, the people have begun
looting. I don’t wonder. There’ll be famine, as
well as cold, in this corner of the world soon, and
then the distant prospect of 150,000 British troops at
Salonika won’t help much.</p>

<p>‘The beloved British troops,&mdash;the thought of them
always cheers. But not the thought of the idiots at
the top who had not enough gumption to <em>know</em> this
must happen. Anybody, even us women, could have
told them that the Germans must try and break
through to the help of the Turks.</p>

<p>‘We have got a nice building here for a hospital, and
Dr. Holloway is helping in the military hospital. I
believe there are about 1000 wounded in the place. I
can’t write a very interesting letter, Amy dear, because
at the bottom of my heart I don’t believe it will ever
reach you. I don’t see them managing the Montenegrin
passes at this time of year! There is a persistent
rumour that the French have retaken Skopiro,
and if that is true perhaps the Salonika route will be
open soon.</p>

<p>‘Some day, I’ll tell you all the exciting things that
have been happening, and all the funny things too!
For there have been funny things, in the middle of all
the sadness. The guns are booming away, and the
country looking so lovely in the sunlight. I wonder
if Serbia is a particularly beautiful country, or whether
it looks so lovely because of the tragedy of this war, just
as bed seems particularly delightful when the night bell
goes!’</p>

military hospital, and living in it also. You can

</blockquote>

<p>With the invasion came the question of evacuation.
At one time it was possible the whole of the
British unit might escape <i>via</i> Montenegro. Sir Ralph
Paget, realising that the equipment could not be
saved, allowed any of the hospital unit who wished
to remain with their wounded. Two parties went
with the retreating Serbs, and their story and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
extraordinary hardships they endured has been
told elsewhere.</p>

<p>Those left at Krushieevatz were in Dr. Inglis’
opinion the fortunate units. For three months they
tended the Serbian wounded under foreign occupation.
The unit with Dr. Inglis kept to their work,
and when necessary confronted the Austro-German
officers with all the audacity of their leader and the
Scottish thistle combined.</p>

<p>Their hospital accommodation was designed for
400 beds. When we went up there were 900
patients. During the greatest part of the pressure
the number rose to 1200. Patients were placed in
the corridors&mdash;at first one man to one bed, but later
two beds together, and three men in them. Then
there were no more bedsteads, and mattresses were
placed on the floor. We filled up the outhouses.
The magazine in full blast was a sight, once seen,
never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Upstairs the patients occupied the shelving.
There were three tiers, the slightly wounded men
in the highest tier. The magazine was under Dr.
Holloway, and Dr. Inglis says the time to see the
place at its best or its worst was in the gloaming,
when two or three feeble oil lamps illuminated the
gloom, and the tin bowls clattered and rattled as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the evening ration of beans was given out, and the
men swarmed up and down the poles of their shelves
chattering as Serbs will chatter. The Sisters called
the place ‘the Zoo.’</p>

<p>The dread of the renewal of the typhus scourge,
amid such conditions of overcrowding, underfeeding,
fatigue and depression, was great. Dr. Inglis
details the appalling tasks the unit undertook in
sanitation. There was no expert amongst them:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘When we arrived, the hospital compound was a
truly terrible place&mdash;the sights and smells beyond
description. We dug the rubbish into the ground,
emptied the overflowing cesspool, built incinerators,
and cleaned, and cleaned, and cleaned. That is an
Englishman’s job all over the world. Our three untrained
English girl orderlies took to it like ducks to
water. It was not the pleasantest or easiest work in the
world; but they did it, and did it magnificently.</p>

<p>‘Laundry and bathing arrangements were installed
and kept going. We had not a single case of typhus;
we had a greater achievement than its prevention.
Late of an evening, when men among the prisoners
were put into the wards, straight from the march,
unwashed and crawling with lice, there was great indignation
among the patients already in. “Doktoritza,”
they said, “if you put these dirty men in among us
we shall all get typhus.” Our hearts rejoiced. If we
have done nothing else, we thought, we have driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that fact home to the Serbian mind that dirt and
typhus go together.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Inglis describes the misery of the Serbian
prisoners:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘They had seen men go out to battle, conscious of
the good work they had done for the Allies in driving
back the Austrians in their first punitive expedition.
We are the only ones who, so far, have beaten our
enemy. They came back to us broken and dispirited.
They were turned into the hospital grounds, with a
scanty ration of beans, with a little meat and half a loaf
of bread for twenty-four hours. Their camp fires
flickered fitfully through the long bitter cold nights.
Every scrap of wood was torn up, the foot bridges
over the drains, and the trees hacked down for firewood.
We added to the rations of our sanitary workers, we
gave away all the bread we could, but we could not feed
that enclosure of hungry men. We used to hear them
coughing and moaning all night.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Inglis details the starving condition of the
whole country, the weakness of the famine-stricken
men who worked for them, the starved yoke oxen,
and all the manifold miseries of a country overrun
by the enemy.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘There was,’ she says, ‘a curious exhilaration in working
for those grateful patient men, and in helping the
director, Major Nicolitch, so loyal to his country and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
conscientious in his work, to bring order out of chaos,
and yet the unhappiness in the Serbian houses, and the
physical wretchedness of those cold hungry prisoners
lay always like a dead weight on our spirit. Never
shall we forget the beauty of the sunrises, or the glory
of the sunsets, with clear, cold sunlit days between,
and the wonderful starlit nights. But we shall never
forget “the Zoo” either, or the groans outside the
windows when we hid our heads under the blankets to
shut out the sound. The unit got no news, and they
made it a point of honour to believe nothing said in
the German telegrams. We could not believe Serbia
had been sacrificed for nothing. We were convinced
it was some deep laid scheme for weakening other
fronts, and so it was natural to believe rumours, such
as that the English had taken Belgium, and the French
were in Metz.</p>

<p>‘The end of the five months of service in captivity,
and to captive Serbs ended. On the 11th February
1916, they were sent north under an Austrian guard
with fixed bayonets, thus to Vienna, and so by slow
stages they came to Zürich.</p>

<p>‘It was a great thing to be once more “home” and
to realise how strong and straight and fearless a people
inhabit these islands: to realise not so much that they
mean to win the war, but rather that they consider
any other issue impossible.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Dr. Inglis came back to plan new campaigns
for the help of the Serbian people, who lay night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and day upon her heart. She knew she had the
backing of the Suffrage societies, and she intended
to get the ear of the English public for the cause
of the Allies in the Balkans. ‘We,’ who had sent
her out, found her changed in many ways. Physically
she had altered much, and if we could ever
have thought of the body in the presence of that
dauntless spirit, we might have seen that the
Angel of Shadows was not far away. The privations
and sufferings she described so well when she
had to speak of her beloved Serbs had been fully
shared by the unit. Their comfort was always
her thought; she never would have anything that
could not be shared and shared alike, but there
was little but hardship to share, and one and all
scorned to speak of privations which were a light
affliction compared to those of a whole nation
groaning and waiting to be redeemed from its great
tribulation.</p>

<p>There was a look in her face of one whose spirit

<p>She could never forget the tragedy of Serbia, and
she came home, not to rest, but vowed to yet
greater endeavours for their welfare. The attitude
of the Allies she did not pretend to understand.
She had something of the spirit of Oliver Cromwell,
when he threatened to send his fleet across the Alps
to help the Waldensians. In her public speeches,
when she set forth what in her outlook could have
been done, no censor cut out the sentences which
were touched by the live coals from off her altar
of service. Dr. Elsie never recognised the word
‘impossible’ for herself, and for her work that was
well. As to her political and military outlook, the
story of the nations will find it a place in the history
of the war.</p>

<p>For a few months she worked from the bases
of her two loyal Committees in London and Edinburgh.
She spoke at many a public meeting, and
filled many a drawing-room. The Church of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Scotland knew her presence in London. ‘One of
our most treasured memories will be that keen,
clever face of hers in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columba’s of a Sunday&mdash;with
the far, wistful melancholy in it, added to
its firm determination.’ So writes the minister.
‘We’ knew what lay behind the wistful brave eyes,
a yet more complete dedication to the service of her
Serbian brethren.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dr. Inglis’</span> return to England was the signal for
renewed efforts on the part of the Committees
managing the S.W.H. This memoir has necessarily
to follow the personality of the leader, but it must
never be forgotten that her strength and all her
sinews of war lay in the work of those who carried
on at home, week by week. Strong committees of
women, ably organised and thoroughly staffed, took
over the burden of finance&mdash;a matter Dr. Inglis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
once amusingly said, ‘did not interest her.’ They
found and selected the <i>personnel</i> on which success
so much depended, they contracted for and supervised
the sending out of immense consignments of
equipment and motor transport. They dealt with
the Government department, and in loyal devotion
smoothed every possible obstacle out of the path
of those flying squadrons, the units of the S.W.H.</p>

<p>It was inevitable the quick brain and tenacious
energy of Dr. Inglis, far away from the base of her
operations, should at times have found it hard to
understand why the wheels occasionally seemed to
drag, and the new effort she desired to make did
not move at the pace which to her eager spirit
seemed possible. Two enterprises filled her mind
on her return in 1916. One, by the help of the
London Committee, she put through. This was the
celebration of Kossovo Day in Great Britain. The
flag-day of the Serbian Patriot King was under her
chairmanship prepared for in six weeks. Hundreds
of lectures on the history of Serbia were arranged
for and delivered throughout the country, and no
one failed to do her work, however remote they
might think the prospect of making the British
people interested in a country and patriot so far
from the ken of their island isolation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Kossovo Day was a success, and through the rush
of the work Dr. Inglis was planning the last and
most arduous of all the undertakings of the S.W.H.,
that of the unit which was to serve with the Serbian
Volunteers on the Rumanian Russian front. Dr.
Inglis knew from private sources the lack of hospital
arrangements in Mesopotamia, and she, with the
backing of the Committees, had approached the
authorities for leave to take a fully equipped unit
to Basra. When the story of the Scottish Women’s
Hospital is written, the correspondence between the
War Office, the Foreign Office, and S.W.H. will
throw a tragic light on this lamentable episode, and,
read with the report of the Committees, it will prove
how quick and foreseeing of trouble was her outlook.
As soon as Dr. Inglis brought her units back
from Serbia, she again urged the War Office to send
her out. Of her treatment by the War Office,
Mrs. Fawcett writes: ‘She was not only refused,
but refused with contumely and insult.’</p>

<p>True to her instinct never to pause over a set-back,
she lost no time in pressing on her last enterprise
for the Serbians. M. Curcin, in <cite>The Englishwoman</cite>,
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘She was already acquainted with one side of the
Serbian problem&mdash;Serbia; she was told that in Russia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
there was the best opportunity to learn about the
second half&mdash;the Serbs of Austria, the Jugoslavs. In
six weeks Dr. Inglis succeeded in raising a hospital
unit and transport section staffed by eighty women
heroes of the Scottish Women’s Hospitals to start with
her on a most adventurous undertaking, <i>via</i> Archangel,
through Russia to Odessa and the Dobrudja. Dr.
Inglis succeeded also&mdash;most difficult of all&mdash;in getting
permission from the British authorities for the journey.
Eye-witnesses&mdash;officers and soldiers&mdash;tell everybody
to-day how those women descended, practically straight
from the railway carriages, after forty days’ travelling,
beside the stretchers with wounded, and helped to
dress the wounds of those who had had to defend the
centre and also a wing of the retreating army. For
fifteen months she remained with those men, whose
<i>rôle</i> is not yet fully realised, but is certain to become
one of the most wonderful and characteristic facts of the
conflagration of nations.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Edinburgh Committee had already so many
undertakings on behalf of the S.W.H. that they
gladly allowed the Committee formed by the London
Branch of the N.U.W.S.S. to undertake the whole
work of organising this last adventure for the
Serbian Army. It was as their Commissioner that
Dr. Inglis and her unit sailed the wintry main,
and to them she sent the voluminous and brilliant
reports of her work. When the Russian revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
imperilled the safety of the Serbian Army on the
Rumanian front, she sent home members of her
unit, charged with important verbal messages to
her Government. Through the last anxious month,
when communications were cut off, short messages,
unmistakably her own, came back to the London
Committee, that they might order her to return. She
would come with the Serbian Army and not without
them. We at home had to rest on the assurances
of the Foreign Office, always alive to the care and
encouragement of the S.W.H., that Dr. Inglis and
her unit were safe, and that their return would be
expedited at the safest hour. In those assurances
we learnt to rest, and the British Government did
not fail that allied force&mdash;the Serbian Army and
the Scottish women serving them. The following
letters were those written to her family with notes
from her graphic report to her Committees. The
clear style and beautiful handwriting never changed
even in those last days, when those who were with
her knew that nothing but the spirit kept the wasted
body at its work. ‘The Serbian Division is superb;
we are proud to be attached to it.’ These were the
last words in her last letter from Odessa in June
1917. That pride of service runs through all the
correspondence. The spirit she inspired is noteworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
in a book which covers the greater part of
these fifteen months, <cite>With the Scottish Nurses in
Rumania</cite>, by Yvonne Fitzroy. In a daily diary
a searchlight is allowed to fall on some of the experiences
borne with such high-hearted nonchalance
by the leader and her gallant disciples.</p>

<p>Mrs. Haverfield, who saw her work, writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘It was perfectly incredible that one human being
could do the work she accomplished. Her record
piece of work perhaps was at Galatz, Rumania, at the
end of the retreat. There were masses and masses
of wounded, and she and her doctors and nurses performed
operations and dressings for fifty-eight hours
out of sixty-three. Dr. Scott, of the armoured cars,
noted the time, and when he told her how long she had
been working, she simply said, “Well, it was all due to
Mrs. Milne, the cook, who kept us supplied with hot
soup.” She had been very tired for a long time; undoubtedly
the lack of food, the necessity of sleeping on
the floor, and nursing her patients all the time told on
her health. In Russia she was getting gradually more
tired until she became ill. When she was the least
bit better she was up again, and all the time she
attended to the business of the unit.</p>

<p>‘Just before getting home she had a relapse, and the
last two or three days on board ship, we know now, she
was dying. She made all the arrangements for the
unit which she brought with her, however, and interviewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
every member of it. To Miss Onslow, her
transport officer, she said, when she arrived at Newcastle,
“I shall be up in London in a few days’ time,
and we will talk the matter of a new unit over.” Miss
Onslow turned away with tears in her eyes.’</p>

‘<span class="smcap">H.M. Transport</span> &mdash;&mdash;,<br />
<span class="in_a_bit2">‘<i><abbr title="September">Sep.</abbr> 6, 1916</i>.</span>
</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dearest Amy</span>,&mdash;Here we are more than half way
through our voyage. We got off eventually on
Wednesday night, and lay all Thursday in the river.
You never in your life saw such a filthy boat as this
was when we came on board. The captain had been
taken off an American liner the day before. The only
officer who had been on this boat before was the
engineer officer. All the rest were new. The crew
were drunk to a man, and, as the Transport officer said,
“The only way to get this ship right, is to get her <em>out</em>.”
So we got out. I must say we got into shape very
quickly. We cleaned up, and now we are painting.
They won’t know her when she gets back. She is an
Austrian Lloyd captured at the beginning of the war,
and she has been trooping in the Mediterranean since.
She was up at Glasgow for this new start, but she struck
the Glasgow Fair, and could therefore get nothing done,
so she was brought down to the port we started from&mdash;as
she was. We are a wonderful people! The captain
seems to be an awfully good man. He is Scotch, and
was on the Anchor Line to Bombay. This is quite a
tiny little boat. She has all our equipment, fourteen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
our cars. For passengers, there are ourselves, seventy-five
people, and three Serbian officers, and the mother
and sister of one of them, and thirty-two Serbian non-commissioned
officers. They are going to our Division.</p>

<p>‘The cabins are most comfortable. On the saloon
deck there are twenty-two very small, single cabins.
And on this deck larger cabins with either three or
four berths. I am on this deck in the most luxurious
quarters. It is called <em>The Commanding Officer’s Cabin</em>
(ahem). There is a huge cabin with one berth; off it
on one side another cabin with a writing-table and sofa,
and off it on the other side a bathroom and dressing-room!
Of course, if we had had rough weather, and
the ports had had to be closed, it would not have been
so nice, especially as the glass in all the portholes is
blackened, but we have had perfectly glorious weather.
At night every porthole and window is closed to shut
in the light, but the whole ship is very well ventilated.
A good many of them sleep up in the boats, or in one
of the lorries.</p>

<p>‘We sighted one submarine, but it took no notice
of us, so we took no notice of it. We had all our boats
allotted to us the very first day. We divided the unit
among them, putting one responsible person in charge
of each, and had boat drill several times. Then one
day the captain sounded the alarm for practice, and
everybody was at their station in three minutes in greatcoat
and life-belt. The amusing thing was that some
of them thought it was a real alarm, and were most
annoyed and disappointed to find there was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
submarine really there! The unit as a whole seems
very nice and capable, though there are one or two
queer characters! But most of them are healthy,
wholesome bricks of girls. I hope we shall get on all
right. Of course a field hospital is quite a new bit of
work.</p>

<p>‘We reach our port of disembarkation this afternoon.
The voyage has been a most pleasant one in every way.
As soon as sea-sickness was over the unit developed a
tremendous amount of energy, and we have had games
on deck, and concerts, and sports, and a fancy dress
competition! All this in addition to drill every morning,
which was compulsory.</p>

<p>‘We began the day at 8.30&mdash;breakfast, the cabins
were tidied. 9.30&mdash;roll call and cabin inspection immediately
after; then drill&mdash;ordinary drill, stretcher
drill, and Swedish drill in sections. Lunch was at
12.30, and then there were lessons in Russian, Serbian,
and French, to which they could go if they liked, and
most of them took one, or even two, and lectures on
motor construction, etc. Tea at 4, and dinner 6.30.
You would have thought there was not much time for
anything else, but the superfluous energy of a British
unit manages to put a good deal more in. (The head
of a British unit in Serbia once said to me that the chief
duty of the head of a British unit was to use up the
superfluous energy of the unit in harmless ways. He
said that the only time there was no superfluous energy
was when the unit was overworking. That was the
time I found that particular unit playing rounders!)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
The sports were most amusing. I was standing next
to a Serb officer during the obstacle race, and he
suddenly turned to me and said, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est tout-à-fait
nouveau pour nous, Madame.</span>” I thought it must be,
for at that moment they were getting under a sail
which had been tied down to the deck&mdash;two of them
hurled themselves on the sail and dived under it, you
saw four legs kicking wildly, and then the sail heaved
and fell, and two dishevelled creatures emerged at the
other side, and tore at two life-belts which they went
through, and so on. I should think it was indeed
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout-à-fait nouveau</i>. Some of the dresses at the fancy
dress competition were most clever. There was
Napoleon&mdash;the last phase, in the captain’s long coat
and somebody’s epaulettes, and one of our grey hats,
side to the front, excellent; and Tweedledum and
Tweedledee, in saucepans and life-belts. One of them
got herself up as a “greaser,” and went down to the
engine-room to get properly dirty, with such successful
result that, when she was coming up to the saloon,
with her little oiling can in her hand, one of the officers
stopped her with, “Now, where are you going to, my
lad?”</p>

<p>‘We ended up with all the allied National Anthems,
the Serbs leading their own.</p>

<p>‘I do love to see them enjoying themselves, and to
hear them chattering and laughing along the passages,
for they’ll have plenty of hard work later. We had
service on Sunday, which I took, as the captain could
not come down. Could you get us some copies of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Archbishop of Canterbury’s war prayers? We have
just had our photograph taken. The captain declares
he was snap-shotted six times one morning. I don’t
know if the Russian Government will let us take all
these cameras with us. We are flying the Union Jack
for the first time to-day since we came out. It is good
to know you are all thinking of us.&mdash;Ever your loving
sister,</p>

</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dearest Amy</span>,&mdash;Here we are well on our way to
Moscow, having got through Archangel in 2½ days&mdash;a
feat, for we were told at home that it might be six
weeks. They did not know that there is a party of our
naval men there helping the Russians, and Archangel
is magnificently organised now.</p>

<p>‘When one realises that the population was 5000
before the war, and is now 20,000, it is quite clear there
was bound to be some disorganisation at first.</p>

<p>‘I never met a kinder set of people than are collected
at Archangel just now. They simply did everything
for us, and sent us off in a train with a berth for each
person, and gave us a wonderful send off. The Russian
Admiral gave us a letter which acts as a kind of magic
ring whenever it is produced. The first time it was
really quite startling. We were longing for Nyamdonia
where we were to get dinner. We were told we should
be there at four o’clock, then at five, and at six o’clock
we pulled up at a place unknown, and rumours began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to spread that our engine was off, and sure enough it
was, and was shunting trucks. Miss Little, one of our
Russian-speaking people, and I got out. We tried our
united eloquence, she in fluent Russian, and I saying,
<i>Shechaz</i>, which means “immediately” at intervals,
and still they looked helpless and said, “Two hours and
a half.” Then I produced my letter, and you never
saw such a change. They said, “Five minutes,” and
we were off in three. We tried it all along the line
after that; my own belief is that we should still be
at the unknown place, without that letter, shunting
trucks. At one station, Miss Little heard the station-master
saying, “There is a great row going on here,
and there will be trouble to-morrow if this train isn’t
got through.” Eventually, we reached Nyamdonia at
11.30, and found a delightful Russian officer, and an
excellent dinner paid for by the Russian Government,
waiting for us. We all thought the food very good,
and I thought the sauce of hunger helped. The
next day, profiting over our Nyamdonia experience, I
said meals were to be had at regular times from our
stores in the train, and we should take the restaurants
as we found them, with the result that we arrived at
Vorega, where <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</i> had been ordered just as we
finished a solid lunch of ham and eggs. I said they
had better go out and have two more courses, which
they did with great content, and found it quite as nice
as the night before.</p>

<p>‘This is a special train for us and the Serbian officers
and non-coms. We broke a coupling after we left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Nyamdonia, and they sent out another carriage from
there, but it had not top berths, so they had another
sleeper ready when we reached Vologda. They gave
us another and stronger engine at Nyamdonia, because
we asked for it, and have repaired cisterns, and given
us chickens and eggs; and when we thank them, they
say, “It is for our friends.” The crowd stand round
three deep while we eat, and watch us all the time,
quite silently in the stations. In Archangel one old
man asked, “Who, on God’s earth, are you?”</p>

<p>‘They gave us such a send-off from Archangel!
Russian soldiers were drawn up between the ship
and the train, and cheered us the whole way, with
a regular British cheer; our own crew turned out with
a drum and a fife and various other instruments,
and marched about singing. Then they made speeches,
and cheered everybody, and then suddenly the Russian
soldiers seized the Serbian officers and tossed them
up and down, up and down, till they were stopped by
a whistle. But they had got into the mood by then,
and they rushed at me. You can imagine, I fled,
and seized hold of the British Consul. I did think
the British Empire would stand by me, but he would
do nothing but laugh. And I found myself up in
the air above the crowd, up and down, quite safe,
hands under one and round one. They were so happy
that I waved my hand to them, and they shouted and
cheered. The unit is only annoyed that they had
not their cameras, and that anyhow it was dark.
Then they tossed Captain Bevan, who is in command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
there, because he was English, and the Consul for
the same reason, and the captain of the transport
because he had brought us out. We sang all the
national anthems, and then they danced for us. It
was a weird sight in the moonlight. Some of the
dances were like Indian ones, and some reminded me
of our Highland flings. We went on till one in the
morning&mdash;all the British colony, there. I confess, I
was tired&mdash;though I did enjoy it. Captain Bevan’s
good-bye was the nicest and so unexpected&mdash;simply
“God bless you.” Mrs. Young, the Consul’s wife,
Mrs. Kerr, both Russians, simply gave up their whole
time to us, took the girls about, and Mrs. Kerr had
<em>the whole unit</em> to tea. I had lunch one day at the
British Mess, and another day at the Russian Admiral’s.
They all came out to dinner with us.</p>

<p>‘Of course a new face means a lot in an out-of-the-way
place, and seventy-five new faces was a God-send.
Well, as I said before, they are the kindest set of
people I ever came across. They brought us our
bread, and changed our money, and arranged with
the bank, and got us this train with berths, and thought
of every single thing for us.</p>

from Archangel; with all the lines blocked with military
trains, that is not bad. All the same we have had
some struggles, but it has been a very comfortable

of us in her motor. They are both very busy people.
She has a beautiful hospital, a clearing one at the
station, and he is a member of the Duma, and Commandant
of all the Red Cross work in Moscow. We
only had a glimpse of the Kremlin, yet enough to
make one want to see more. I carried away one beautiful
picture to remember&mdash;the view of Moscow in the
sunset light, simply gorgeous.</p>

<p>‘The unit are very very well, and exceedingly cheerful.
I am not sorry to have had these three weeks since we

order now. When <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Malinina said it was time to leave

Miss H. says they are like eels in a basket. They were
told not to eat fruit without peeling it, so one of them
peeled an apple with her teeth. They were told not
to drink unboiled water, so they handed their water-bottles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
out at dead of night to Russian soldiers, to
whom they could not explain, to fill for them, as of
course they understood they were not to fill them from
water on the train. I must say they are an awfully

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dearest Amy</span>,&mdash;We have left Odessa and are really
off to our Division. We are going to the 1st Division.
General Haditch is in command there. We were told
this is the important point in the war just now&mdash;“A
Second Verdun.” The great General Mackensen is
in command against us. He was in command at
Krushinjevatz when we were taken prisoners. Every
one says how anxiously they are looking out for us, and,
indeed, we shall have our work cut out for us. We
are two little field hospitals for a whole Division.
Think if that was the provision for our own men. They
are such a magnificent body of men. We saw the
2nd Division preparing in Odessa. Only from the
point of view of the war, they ought to be looked after,
but when one remembers that they are men, every one
of them with somebody who cares for them, it is
dreadful. I wish we were each six women instead of
one. I have wired home for another Base Hospital
to take the place of the British Red Cross units when
they move on with the 2nd Division. The Russians are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
splendid in taking the Serbs into their Base Hospitals,
but you can imagine what the pressure is from their
own huge armies. We had such a reception at Odessa.
All the Russian officials, at the station, and our Consul,
and a line drawn up of twenty Serbian officers. They
had a motor car and forty droskies and a squad of
Serbian soldiers to carry up our personal luggage, and
most delightful quarters for us on the outskirts of the
town in a sanatorium. We were the guests of the
city while we were there. Our Consul was so good and
helpful. Odessa is immensely interested in us. We
were told that the form of greeting while we were there
was, “Have you seen <em>them</em>?” The two best things
were the evening at the Serbian Mess, and the gala
performance at the opera. The cheering of the Serbian
mess when we went in was something to remember, but
I can tell you I felt quite choking when the whole house
last night turned round and cheered us after we tried
to sing our National Anthem to them with the orchestra.</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dearest Amy</span>,&mdash;I am writing this on the boat
between Tulcea and Ismail, where I am going to see our
second hospital and the transport. Admiral Vesolskin
has given me a special boat, and we motored over from
Braila. The Étappen command had been expecting
us all afternoon, and the boat was ready. They were
very amused to find that “the doctor” they had been
expecting was a <em>woman</em>!</p>

<p>‘Our main hospital was at Medgidia, and our field
hospital at Bulbulmic, only about seven miles from
the front. They gave us a very nice building, a barrack,
at Medgidia for the hospital, and the <i>personnel</i> were in
tents on the opposite hill. We arrived on the day of
the offensive, and were ready for patients within forty-eight
hours. We were there less than three weeks,
and during that time we unpacked the equipment and
repacked it. We made really a rather nice hospital
at Medgidia, and the field hospital. We pitched and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
struck the camp&mdash;we were nursing and operating the
whole time, and evacuating rapidly too, and our cars
were on the road practically always.</p>

<p>‘The first notice we got of the retreat was our field
hospital being brought back five versts. Then the
transport. Then we were told to send the equipment
to Galatz, but to keep essential things and the <i>personnel</i>.
Then came orders to go ourselves. I never saw such a
retreat. Serbia was nothing to it. The whole country
was covered with groups of soldiers who had lost their
regiments. Russians, Serbs, and Rumanians. The
Rumanian guns were simply being rushed back,
through the crowds of refugees. The whole country
was moving: in some places the panic was awful.
One part of our scattered unit came in for it. You
would have thought the Bulgars were at the heels of the
people. One man threw away a baby right in front of
the cars. They were throwing everything off the carts
to lighten them, and our people, being of a calmer
disposition, picked up what they wanted in the way of
vegetables, etc. Men, with their rifles and bayonets,
climbed on to the Red Cross cars to save a few minutes.
We simply went head over heels out of the country.
I want to collect all the different stories of our groups.
My special lot slept the first night on straw in Caromacat;
the next night on the roadside round a lovely fire;
the next (much reduced in numbers, for I had cleared
the majority off in barges for Galatz), we slept in an
empty room at Hershova, and spent the next day
dressing at the wharf. And by the next night we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
in Braila, involved in the avalanche of wounded that
descended on that place, and there we have been ever
since.</p>

<p>‘We found some of our transport, and, while we were
having tea, an officer came in and asked us to go round
and help in a hospital. There, we were told, there
were 11,000 wounded (I believe the official figures are
7000). They had been working thirty-six hours
without stopping when we arrived.</p>

<p>‘The wounded had overflowed into empty houses,
and were lying about in their uniforms, and their
wounds not dressed for four or five days. You can
imagine the conditions.</p>

<p>‘So we just turned up our sleeves and went in. I
got back all the trained Sisters from Galatz, and now
the pressure is over. One thing I am going up to
Ismail for, is to get into touch with the Serbian H. 2,
and find out what they want us to do next. The Serb
wounded were evacuated straight to Odessa.</p>

<p>‘The unit as a whole has behaved splendidly, plucky
and cheery through everything, and game for any
amount of work.</p>

<p>‘And we are prouder of our Serbs than ever. I do
hope the papers at home have realised what the 1st
Division did, and how they suffered in the fight in the
middle of September. General Genlikoffsky said to
me, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’était magnifique, magnifique! Ils sont les héros</i>”;&mdash;and
another Russian: “We did not quite believe in
these Austrian Serbs, but no one will ever doubt
them again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Personally, I have been awfully well, and prouder
than ever of British women. I wish you could have
seen trained Sisters scrubbing floors at Medgidia, and
those strapping transport girls lifting the stretchers
out of the ambulances so steadily and gently. I have
told in the Report how Miss Borrowman and Miss
Brown brought the equipments through to Galatz.
We lost only one Ludgate boiler and one box of radiators.
We lost two cars, but that was really the fault of a
rather stupid Serbian officer. It is a comfort to feel
you are all thinking of us.&mdash;Your loving sister,</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Darling Eve</span>,&mdash;Now we have got a hospital at
Reni again, for badly wounded, working in connection
with the evacuation station. We have got the
dearest little house to live in ourselves, but, as we are
getting far more people out from Odessa, we shall
have to overflow into the Expedition houses. Reni
itself is quite a small village. I remember thinking
Reni a most uninteresting place&mdash;crowds of shipping
and the wharf all crammed with sacks. It was just
a big junction like Crewe!</p>

<p>‘The hospital at Reni is a real building, but it is not
finished. One unfinished bit is the windows, which
have one layer of glass each, though they have double
sashes. When this was pointed out, I thought it was
a mere continental foible. When the cold came I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
realised that there is some sense in this foible after
all! We <em>cannot</em> get the wards warm, notwithstanding
extra stoves and roaring fires. The poor Russians
do mind cold so much. But they don’t want to leave
the hospital. One man whom I told he must have
an operation later on in another hospital, said
he would rather wait for it in ours. The first time
we had to evacuate, we simply could not get the men
to go. Nice, isn’t it?</p>

<p>‘We have got a Russian Secretary now, because we
are using Russian Red Cross money, and he told us
he had been told in Petrograd that the S.W.H. were
beautifully organised, and the only drawback was
the language. Quite true. I wish we were polyglots.
We have got a certain number of Austrian prisoners
as orderlies, and most of them curiously can speak
Russian, so we get on better. Did you know I could
speak German? I did not until I had to! This is a
most comfortable way of travelling, and the quickest.
We have 500 wounded on board, twenty-three of
them ours. I am going to Odessa to find out why
we cannot get Serb patients. There are still thousands
of them in Odessa, and yet Dr. Chesney gets nothing but
Russians. The Serbs we meet seem to think it is somehow
our fault! I tell them I have written and telegraphed,
and planned and made two journeys to Ismail,
to try and get a real Serbian Hospital going, and yet it
doesn’t go.</p>

<p>‘What did happen over the change of Government?
I do hope we have got the right lot now, to put things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
straight at home, and carry through things abroad.
Remember it all depends on you people at home.
<em>The whole thing depends on us.</em> I know we lose the
perspective in this gloomy corner, but there is one
thing quite clear, and that is that they are all trusting
to our <em>sticking</em> powers. They know we’ll hold on&mdash;of
course&mdash;I only wish we would realise that it would
be as well to use our intellects too, and have them
clear of alcohol.’</p>

for the Serbs at Medgidia, then in a Rumanian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
hospital at Braila, and then for the Russians at Galatz
and Reni. In the very middle, by some funny mistake,
we were sent flying right on to the front line. However
we nipped out again just in time, and the station
was burnt to the ground just half an hour after we
left. I’ll tell you the name of the place when the
war is over, and show it to you on the map. We saw
the petrol tanks on fire as we came away, and the
ricks of grain too.</p>

<p>‘Our hospital at Galatz was in a school. I don’t
think the children in these parts are doing many
lessons during the war, and that will be a great handicap
for their countries afterwards. Perhaps, however,
they are learning other lessons. When we left the
Dobrudja we saw the crowds of refugees on their
carts, with the things they had been able to save,
and all the little children packed in among the furniture
and pots and pans and pigs.</p>

<p>‘In one cart I saw two fascinating babies about three
years old, sitting in a kind of little nest made of pillows
and rugs. They were little girls, one fair and one
dark, and they sat there, as good as gold, watching
everything with such interest. There were streams
of carts along the roads, and all the villages deserted.
That is what the war means out here. It is not quite
so bad in our safe Scotland, is it?&mdash;thanks to the
fleet. And that is why it seems to me we have got
to help these people, because they are having the worst
of it. I wonder if you can knit socks yet, for I can

weather here, such snowstorms sweeping across the
plain. You should see the snowdrifts. One day I
really thought the house would be cut off from the
hospital. The unit going over to Roll was quite a
sight, with the indiarubber boots, and peaked Russian
caps, with the ends twisted round their throats. We
should have thoroughly enjoyed it if it had not been
for the shortage of fuel. However, we were never
absolutely without wood, and now have plenty, as a
Cossack regiment sent a squad of men across the
Danube to cut for us, and we brought it back in our
carts. The Danube is frozen right across&mdash;such a
curious sight. The first time in seven years, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
say&mdash;so nice of it to do it just when we are here! I
would not have missed it for anything. The hospital
has only had about forty patients for some time, as there
has been no fighting, and it was just as well when we
were so short of wood. We collected them all into
one ward, and let the other fires out.</p>

<p>‘The chief of the medical department held an inspection.
That was an inspection! The old gentleman
poked into every corner. Took off the men’s
shirts and looked for lice, turned up the sheets, and
beat the mattresses to look for dust, tasted the men’s
food, and in the end stated we were <i>ochin chesté</i> (very
clean), and that the patients were well cared for
medically and well nursed. All of which was very
satisfactory, but he added that the condition of the
orderlies was disgraceful, and so it was. I hadn’t
realised they were my job. However, I told him
next time he came he should not find one single louse.

<p>‘We have been awfully excited and interested in
the news from Petrograd. We heard of it, probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
long after you people at home knew all about it!
It is most interesting to see how everybody is on the
side of the change, from Russian officers, who come
to tea and beam at us, and say, “Heresho” (good)
to the men in the wards. In any case they say we
shall find the difference all over the war area. One
Russian officer, who was here before the news came,
was talking about the Revolution in England two
hundred years ago, and said it was the most interesting
period of European history. “They say all these
ideas began with the French Revolution, but they
didn’t&mdash;they began long before in England,” he thought.
He spoke English beautifully, and had had an English
nurse. He had read Milton’s political pamphlets, and
we wondered all the time whether he was thinking
of changes in Russia after the war, but now I wonder
if he knew the changes were coming sooner.</p>

<p>‘Do you know we have all been given the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George
Medal? Prince Dolgourokoff, who is in command
on this front, arrived quite unexpectedly, just after
roll call. The telegram saying he was coming arrived
a quarter of an hour after he left! General Kropensky,
the head of the Red Cross, rushed up, and the Prince
arrived about two minutes after him. He went all
over the hospital, and a member of his gilded staff told
matron he was very pleased with everything. He
decorated two men in the wards with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s
Medal, and then said he wanted to see us together,
and shook hands with everybody and said, “Thank
you,” and gave each of us a medal too; Dr. Laird’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
was for service, as she had not been under fire. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
George’s Medal is a silver one with “For Bravery” on
its back. Our patients were awfully pleased, and inpressed
on us that it carried with it a pension of a rouble
a month for life. We gave them all cigarettes to commemorate
the occasion.</p>

<p>‘It was rather satisfactory to see how the hospital
looked in its ordinary, and even I was <em>fairly</em> satisfied.
I tell the unit that they must remember that they have
an old maid as commandant, and must live up to it!
I cannot stand dirt, and crooked charts and crumpled
sheets. One Sister, I hear, put it delightfully in a letter
home: “Our C.M.O. is an idealist!” I thought that
was rather sweet; I believe she added, “but she does
appreciate good work.” Certainly, I appreciate hers.
She is in charge of the room for dressings, and it is
one of the thoroughly satisfactory points in the hospital.</p>

<p>‘The Greek priest came yesterday to bless the
hospital. We put up “Icons” in each of the four
wards. The Russians are a very religious people, and
it seems to appeal to some mystic sense in them. The
priest just put on a stole, green and gold, and came
in his long grey cloak. The two wards open out of
one another, so he held the service in one, the men
all saying the responses and crossing themselves. The
four icons lay on the table before him, with three
lighted candles at the inner comers, and he blessed
water and sprinkled them, and then he sprinkled everybody
in the room. The icons were fixed up in the
corner of the wards, and I bought little lamps to burn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
in front of them, as they always have them. We are
going to have the evening hymn sung every evening at
six o’clock. I heard that first in Serbia from those poor
Russian prisoners, who sang it regularly every evening.</p>

<p>‘The mud has been literally awful. The night nurses
come up from the village literally wet through, having
dragged one another out of mud holes all the way.
Now, a cart goes down to fetch them each evening.
We have twenty horses and nine carts belonging to
us. I have made Vera Holme master of the horse.</p>

<p>‘I have heard two delightful stories from the Sisters
who have returned from Odessa. There is a great
rivalry between the Armoured Car men and the British
Red Cross men, about the capabilities of their Sisters.
(We, it appears, are the Armoured Car Sisters!) A
B.R.C. man said their Sisters were so smart they got
a man on to the operating-table five minutes after
the other one went off. Said an Armoured Car man:
“But that’s nothing. The Scottish Sisters get the
second one on before the first one is off.” The other
story runs that there was some idea of the men waiting
all night on a quay, and the men said, “But you
don’t think we are Scottish Sisters, sir, do you?” I
have no doubt that refers to Galatz, where we made
them work all night.’</p>

stuck in the mud, and came back the next day,

and not a drop of water came through. Miss Pleister
and the Austrian orderly who helped her to pitch
them are triumphant. Do get our spy-incident,
from the office. My dear, they thought we were
spies. We had an awful two days, but it is quite a
joke to look back on. The unit were most thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and Britishly angry. Quite rightly. But I very
soon saw the other side, and managed to get them
in hand once more. General Kropensky, our chief,
was a perfect brick. The armoured car section sent
a special despatch rider over to Galatz to fetch him,
and he came off at once. He talks perfect English,
and he has since written me a charming letter saying
our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang-froid</i> and our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savoir-faire</i> saved the situation.
I am afraid there was not much <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang-froid</i> among us,
but some of us managed to keep hold of our common
sense. As I told the girls, in common fairness they
must look at the other side&mdash;spy fever raging, a foreign
hospital right on the front, and a Revolution in progress.
I told them, even if they did not care about Russia,
I supposed they cared about the war and England,
and I wondered what effect it would have on all these
Russian soldiers if we went away with the thing not
cleared up, and still under suspicion. After all, the
ordinary Russian soldier knows nothing about England,
except in the very concrete form of <em>us</em>. We should
have played right into the devil’s hands if we had
gone away. Of course, they saw it at once, and we
stuck to our guns for England’s sake. The 6th Army,
I think, understands that England, as represented by
this small unit, is keen on the war, and does not spy!
We have had a telegram from the General in command,
apologising, and our patients have been perfectly angelic.
And the men from all regiments round come up to the
out-patients’ department, and are most grateful and
punctiliously polite. So all is well that ends well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>‘We had a very interesting Easter. You know the
Russian greeting on Easter morning, “Christ is risen,”
and the answer, “He is risen indeed.” We learnt
them both, and made our greetings in Russian fashion.
On Easter Eve we went to the church in the village.
The service is at midnight. The church was crowded
with soldiers&mdash;very few women there. They were
most reverent and absorbed outside in the courtyards.
It was a very curious scene; little groups of
people with lighted candles waiting to get in. Here,
we had a very nice Easter service. My “choir”
had three lovely Easter hymns, and we even sang
the Magnificat. One of the armoured car men, on his
way from Galatz to Belgrade, stayed for the service,
and it was nice to have a man’s voice in the singing.
We gave our patients Easter eggs and cigarettes.
Except that we are very idle, we are very happy here.
Our patients are delightful, the hospital in good order.
The Steppe is a fascinating place to wander over,
the little valleys, and the villages hidden away in
them, and the flowers! We have been riding our
transport horses&mdash;rather rough, but quite nice and
gentle. We all ride astride of course.</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Petrie</span>,&mdash;How perfectly splendid about
the Egyptologists. Miss Henderson brought me your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
message, saying how splendidly they are subscribing.
That is of course all due to you, you wonderful woman.
It was such a tantalising thing to hear that you had
actually thought of coming out as an Administrator,
and that you found you could not. I cannot tell you
how splendid it would have been if you could have
come.... I want “a woman of the world” ... and
I want an adaptable person, who will talk to the
innumerable officers who swarm about this place,
and ride with the girls, and manage the officials!</p>

<p>‘I do wish you could see our hospital now. It really
is quite nice. Such a nice story:&mdash;Matron was in
Reni the other day, seeing the Commandant of the town
about some things for the hospital, and when she came
out she found a crowd of Russian soldiers standing
round her house. They asked her if she had got what
she wanted, and she said the Commandant was going
to see about it. Whereupon the men said, “The Commandant
must be told that the Scottish Hospital
(<i>Schottlandsche bolnitza</i>) is the best hospital on this
front, and must have whatever it wants. That is
the opinion of the Russian Soldier.” Do you recognise
the echo of the big reverberation that has shaken
Russia. We get on awfully well with the Russian
soldier. Two of our patients were overheard talking
the other day, and they said, “The Russian Sisters
are pretty but not good, and the English Sisters are
good and not pretty.” The story was brought up
to the mess-room by quite a nice-looking girl who had
overheard it. But we thought we’d let the judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
stand and be like Kingsley’s “maid”&mdash;though we
<em>don’t</em> undertake to endorse the Russian part of it!</p>

<p>‘We have got some of the <i>personnel</i> tents pitched
now, and it is delightful. It was rather close quarters
in the little house. I am writing in my tent now,
looking out over the Danube. Such a lovely place,
Reni is&mdash;and the Steppe is fascinating with its wide
plains and little unexpected valleys full of flowers.
We have some glorious rides over it. The other night
our camp was the centre of a fight. Only a sham
one! They are drilling recruits here, and suddenly
the other night we found ourselves being defended
by one party while another attacked from the Steppe.
The battle raged all night, and the camp was finally
carried at four o’clock in the morning amid shouts and
cheers and barking of dogs. It was even too much
for me, and I have slept through bombardments.</p>

<p>‘It has been so nice hearing about you all from Miss
Henderson. How splendidly the money is coming in.
Only <em>one</em> thing, dear Mrs. Petrie, <em>do</em> make them send
the reliefs more quickly. I know all about boats,
but, as you knew the orderlies had to leave on the
15th of January, the reliefs ought to have been off
by the 1st.</p>

<p>‘I wish you could hear the men singing their evening
hymn in hospital. They have just sung it. I am so
glad we thought of putting up the icons for them.</p>

<p>‘It was delightful seeing Miss Henderson, and
getting news of all you dear people. She took two
months over the journey. But she did arrive with
all her equipment. The equipment I wired for in
October, and which was sent out by itself, arrived in
Petrograd, got through to Jassy, and has there stuck.
We have not got a single thing, and the Consuls have
done their best.</p>

<p>‘Mr. French, one of the chaplains in Petrograd, came
here. He said he would have some services here.
We pitched a tent, and we had the Communion. It
was a joy. I have sent down a notice to the armoured
car yacht, and I hope some of the men will come up.
We and they are the only English people here.</p>

<p>‘The Serbs have sent me a message saying we may
have to rejoin our Division soon. I don’t put too
much weight on this, because I know my dearly beloved
Serbs, and their habit of saying the thing they
think you would like, but still we are preparing. I
shall be very sorry to leave our dear little hospital
here, and the Russians. They are a fascinating people,
especially the common soldier. I hope that as we have
done this work for the Russians and therefore have
some little claim on them, it will help us to get things
more easily for the Serbs. We have one little laddie
in, about ten years old, the most amusing brat. He
was wounded by an aeroplane bomb in a village seven
versts out, and was sent into Reni to a hospital. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
when he got there he found the hospital was for sick only
(a very inferior place!), so he proceeded on to us. He
wanders about with a Russian soldier’s cap on his head
and wrapped round with a blanket, and we hear his
pretty little voice singing to himself all over the place.</p>

<p>‘Nicolai, the man who came in when the hospital
was first opened, and has been so very ill, is really
getting better. He had his dressing left for two days
for the first time the other day, and his excitement and
joy were quite pathetic. “<i>Ochin heroshe doktorutza,
ochin herosho</i>” (Very good, dear doctor, very good), he
kept saying, and then he added, “Now, I know I am
not going to die!” Poor boy, he has nearly died
several times, and would have died if he had not had
English Sisters to nurse him. He has been awfully
naughty&mdash;the wretch. He bit one of the Sisters one
day when she tried to give him his medicine. Now,
he kisses my hand to make up. The other day I
ordered massage for his leg, and he made the most
awful row, howled and whined, and declared it would
hurt (really, he has had enough pain to destroy anybody’s
nerve), and then suddenly pointed to a Sister
who had come in, and said what she had done for him
was the right thing. I asked what she had done for
him; “Massaged his leg,” she said. I got that promptly
translated into Russian, and the whole room roared
with laughter. Poor Nicolai&mdash;after a minute, he joined
in. His home is in Serbia, “a very nice home with a
beautiful garden.” His mother is evidently the important
person there. His father is a smith, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
had meant to be a smith too, but now he has got the
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Cross, which carries with it a pension of six
roubles a month, and he does not think he will do any
work at all. He is the eldest of the family, twenty-four
years old, and has three sisters, and a little brother
of five. Can’t you imagine how he was spoilt! and how
proud they are of him now, only twenty-four, and a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sous-officier</i>, and been awarded the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Cross
which is better than the medal; and been wounded,
four months in hospital, and had three operations!
He has been so ill I am afraid the spoiling continued
in the Scottish Women’s Hospital. Dr. Laird says she
would not be his future wife for anything.</p>

<p>‘We admitted such a nice-looking boy to-day, with
thick, curly, yellow hair, which I had ruthlessly cropped,
against his strong opposition. I doubt if I should have
had the heart, if I had known how ill he was. He will
need a very serious operation. I found him this evening
with tears running silently over his cheeks, a Cossack,
a great big man. His nerve is quite gone. He may
have to go on to Odessa, as a severe operation and
bombs and a nervous breakdown don’t go together.
We will see how he settles down.</p>

<p>‘We have made friends with lots of the officers; there
is one, also a Cossack, who spends a great part of his
time here. His regiment is at the front, and he has been
left for some special work, and he seems rather lonely.
He is a nice boy, and brings nice horses for us to ride.
We have been having quite a lot of riding, on our own
transport horses too. It is heavenly riding here across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the great plain. We all ride astride, and at first we
found the Cossacks’ saddles most awfully uncomfortable,
but now we are quite used to them. Our days fly past
here, and in a sense are monotonous, but I don’t think
we are any of us the worse for a little monotony as an
interlude! Alas! quite fairly often there is a party
at one of the regiments here! The girls enjoy them,
and matron and I chaperone them alternately and
reluctantly. It was quite a rest during Lent when there
were no parties.</p>

<p>‘The spy incident has quite ended, and we have
won. Matron was in Reni the other day asking the
Commandant about something, and when she came
out she found a little crowd of Russian soldiers round
her house. They asked her if she had got what she
wanted, and she said the Commandant had said he
would see about it. They answered, “The Commandant
must be told that the S.W.H. is the best hospital
on this front, and that it must have everything it
wants.” That is the opinion of the Russian soldier!
If you were here you would recognise the new tone of
the Russian soldier in these days,&mdash;but I am glad he
approves of our hospital.’</p>

<p>‘The work at Reni is coming to an end, and we are
to go to the front with the Serbian Division. I cannot
write about it owing to censors and people. But I am
going to risk this: the Serbs ought to be most awfully
proud. The Russian General on the front is going to
insist on having them “to stiffen up his Russian troops.”
I think you people at home ought to know what
magnificent fighting men these Serbs are, and so
splendidly disciplined, simply worth their weight in
gold. There are only two divisions of them after all.
We have about thirty-five of them in hospital just now
as sanitaries, and they are such a comfort; their quickness
and their devotion is wonderful. The hospital
was full and overflowing when I left&mdash;still Russians.

doing such mad things as telegraphing the “Many

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> reports of Dr. Inglis as chief medical officer to
the London Committee were as detailed and foreseeing
in the very last one that she wrote as in the
first from on board the transport that took her and
her unit out. She writes:&mdash;‘In view of the fact
that we are in the middle of big happenings I should
like Dr. Laird to bring ½ ton cotton wool, six bales
moss dressings, 100 lb. chloroform, 50 lb. ether,
20 gallons rectified spirits. I wonder what news of
the river boat for Mesopotamia?’ After they had
landed and were at work:&mdash;‘I have wired asking
for another hospital for the base. I know you have
your hands full, but I also know that if the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
at home realise what their help would mean out
here just now, we would not have to ask twice.
And again:&mdash;’Keep the home fires burning and
let us feel their warmth.’ She soon encountered
the usual obstacles:&mdash;‘I saw that there was no
good in the world talking about regular field
hospitals to them until they had tried our mettle.
The ordinary male disbelief in our capacity cannot
be argued away. It can only be worked away.’ So
she acted. Russia created disbelief, but the men
at arms of all nations saw and believed. In November
she wrote back incredulously:&mdash;‘Rumours
of falling back. Things look serious. Anxious
about the equipment.’ In bombardments, in retreat,
and evacuations the equipment was her one
thought. ‘Stand by the equipment’ became a
joke in her unit. On one occasion one of the
orderlies had a heavy fall from a lorry on which she
was in charge of the precious stuff. Dusty and
shaken, she was gathering herself up, when the voice
of the chief rang out imperatively urgent, ‘Stand by
the equipment.’ On the rail certain trucks, bearing
all the equipment, got on a wrong line, and were
carried away:&mdash;‘The blue ribbon belongs to Miss
Borrowman and Miss Brown. They saw our wagons
disappearing with a refugee train, whereupon these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
two ran after it and jumped on, and finally brought
the equipment safely to Galatz. They invented a
General Popovitch who would be very angry if it
did not get through. Without those two girls and
their ingenuity, the equipment would not have got
through.’</p>

<p>She details all the difficulties of packing up and
evacuating after the despatch rider came with the
order that the hospitals were to fall back to Galatz.
The only method their own, all else chaotic and
helpless, working night and day, the unit accomplished
everything. At the station, packed with a
country and army in flight, Dr. Inglis had a talk
with a Rumanian officer. He told her that he had
been in Glasgow, and had there been invited out
to dinner, and had seen ‘English customs.’ ‘It was
good to feel those English customs were still going
on quietly, whatever was happening here, breakfast
coming regularly and hot water for baths, and
everything as it should be. It was probably absurd,
but it came like a great wave of comfort to feel that
England was there quiet and strong and invincible
behind everything and everybody.’</p>

<p>As we read these natural vivid diary reports, we
too can feel it was good of England that Dr. Inglis
was to the last on that front&mdash;</p>

then went home to the English papers? The Serbian
Division went into the fight 15,000 strong. They were
in the centre&mdash;the Rumanians on their left, and the
Russians on their right. The Rumanians broke, and
they fought for twenty-four hours on two fronts.
They came out of the fight, having lost 11,000 men.

was setting. Her work was accomplished when on
the transport with her and her unit were the representatives
of that Serbian Army with whom she
served, faithful unto death.</p>

<p>Miss Arbuthnot, the granddaughter of Sir William
Muir, the friend of John Inglis, was one of those
who helped to nurse Dr. Inglis:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘I sometimes looked after her when the Sister attending
her was off duty. Her consideration and kindness
were quite extraordinary, while her will and
courage were quite indomitable. To die as she did
in harness, having completed her great work in getting
the Serbs away from Russia, is what she would have
chosen.</p>

<p>‘I first met Dr. Inglis at Hadji Abdul, a small mud
village about ten miles from Galatz. She was looking
very ill, but was always busy. For some time she
had been ill with dysentery, but she never even stayed
in bed for breakfast till it was impossible for her to
move from bed.</p>

<p>‘During our time at Hadji we had about forty Serbian
patients, a few wounded, but mostly sick. Dr. Inglis
did a few minor operations, but her last major one
was a gastro-enterotomy performed on one of our
own chauffeurs, a Serb, Joe, by name. The operation
took three hours and was entirely satisfactory, although
Dr. Inglis did not consider him strong enough to travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
back to England. She was particularly fond of this
man, and took no end of trouble with him. Even after
she became so very ill she used constantly to visit
him.</p>

<p>‘The Serbs entertained us to several picnics, which
we duly returned. Dr. Inglis was always an excellent
hostess, so charming and genial to every one, and so
eager that both entertainers and entertained should
equally enjoy themselves. Provided her permission
was asked first, and duty hours or regular meals not
neglected, she was always keen every one should enjoy
themselves riding, walking, or going for picnics. If
any one was ill, she never insisted on their getting
up in spite of everything, as most doctors, and certainly
all matrons, wish us to do. She was strict
during duty hours, and always required implicit
obedience to her orders&mdash;whatever they were. She
was always so well groomed&mdash;never a hair out of place.
In appearance she was a splendid head. One felt so
proud of her among the dirty and generally unsuitably
dressed women in other hospitals. She was very
independent, and would never allow any of us to wait
on her. The cooks were not allowed to make her
any special dishes that the whole unit could not share.
As long as she could, she messed with the unit, and
there was no possibility of avoiding her quick eye;
anything which was reserved for her special comfort
was rejected. Once, a portion of chicken was kept
as a surprise for her. She asked whether there had
been enough for all, and when the cooks reluctantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
confessed there was only the one portion she sent it
away.</p>

<p>‘During one of the evacuations, an order had been
given that there were only two blankets allowed in
each valise. Some one, mindful of her weakness,
stuffed an extra one into Dr. Inglis’ bag, because in
her emaciated condition she suffered much from the
cold. It stirred her to impetuous anger, and with
something of the spirit of David, as he poured out the
water brought him at the peril of the lives of his
followers, she flung the blanket out of the railway
carriage, as a lesson to those of her unit who had disobeyed
an order.</p>

<p>‘Every Sunday Dr. Inglis read the Church service
with great dignity and simplicity. On the weekday
evenings, before she became so ill, she would join
us in a game of bridge, and played nearly every night.
During the retreats when nothing more could be done,
and she felt anxious, she would sit down and play a
game of patience. During the weeks of uncertainty,
when the future of the Serbs was doubtful, and she
was unable to take any active part, she fretted very
much.</p>

<p>‘After endless conflicting rumours and days of waiting,
the news arrived that they were to go to England.
Her delight was extraordinary, for she had lain in
her bed day after day planning how she could help
them, and sending endless wires to those in authority
in England, but feeling herself very impotent. Once
the good news arrived, her marvellous courage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
tenacity helped her to recover sufficiently, and prepare
all the details for the journey with the Serbs. We left
on the 29th October, with the H.G. Staff and two
thousand Serbian soldiers, in a special train going to
Archangel.</p>

<p>‘Dr. Inglis spent fifteen days on the train, in a
second-class compartment, with no proper bed. Her
strength varied, but she was compelled to lie down
a great deal, although she insisted on dressing every
morning. On two occasions she walked for five
minutes on the station platform; each time it absolutely
exhausted her. Though she suffered much pain
and discomfort, she never complained. She could
only have benger, chicken broth and condensed milk,
and she often found it impossible to take even these.
If one happened to bring her tea, or her food, she
thanked one so charmingly.</p>

<p>‘At Archangel there was no means of carrying her
on to the boat, so with help (one orderly in front, and
one lifting her behind), she climbed a ladder twenty feet
high, from the platform to the deck of the transport.
She was a good sailor, and had a comfortable cabin
on the ship. She improved on board slightly, and
used to sit in the small cabin allotted to us on the
upper deck. She played patience, and was interested
in our sea-sick symptoms. There was a young naval
officer very seriously ill on the boat. Our people
were nursing him, and she constantly went to prescribe;
she feared he would not live, and he died before we
reached our port.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>‘After some improvement, Dr. Inglis had a relapse;
violent pain set in, and she had to return to bed. Even
then, a few days before we reached England, she
insisted on going through all the accounts, and prepared
fresh plans to take the unit on to join the Serbs
at Salonika. In six weeks she expected to be ready
to start. She sent for each of us in turn, and asked
if we would go with her. Needless to say, only those
who could not again leave home, refused, and then
with the deepest regret. The night before we reached
Newcastle, Dr. Inglis had a violent attack of pain,
and had no sleep all night. Next morning she insisted
on getting up to say good-bye to the Serbian staff.</p>

<p>‘It was a wonderful example of her courage and
fortitude, to see her standing unsupported&mdash;a splendid
figure of quiet dignity. Her face ashen and drawn
like a mask, dressed in her worn uniform coat, with
the faded ribbons that had seen such good service.
As the officers kissed her hand, and thanked her for
all she had done for them, she said to each of
them a few words accompanied with her wonderful
smile.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As they looked on her, they also must have understood,
‘sorrowing most of all, that they should see
her face no more.’</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘After that parting was over, Dr. Inglis collapsed
from great weakness. She left the boat Sunday afternoon,
25th November, and arrived quite exhausted
at the hotel. I was allowed to see her for a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
before the unit left for London that night. She could
only whisper, but was as sweet and patient as she ever
was. She said we should meet soon in London.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After her death, many who had watched her
through these strenuous years, regretted that she
did not take more care of herself. Symptoms of
the disease appeared so soon, she must have known
what overwork and war rations meant in her state.
This may be said of every follower of the One who
saved others, but could not save Himself. The
life story of Saint and Pioneer is always the same.
To continue to ill-treat ‘brother body’ meant death
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis; to remain in the fever swamps of
Africa meant death to Livingstone. The poor, and
the freedom of the slave, were the common cause
for which both these laid down their lives. Of the
same spirit was this daughter of our race. Had she
remained at home on her return from Serbia she
might have been with us to-day, but we should not
have the woman we now know, and for whom we
give thanks on every remembrance of her.</p>

<p>The long voyage ended at last. Miss Arbuthnot
makes no allusion to its dangers. Everything
written by the ‘unit’ is instinct with the high
courage of their leader. We know now how great
were the perils surrounding the transports on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
North seas. Old, and unseaworthy, the menace
below, the storm above, through the night of the
Arctic Circle, she was safely brought to the haven
where all would be. More than once death in open
boats was a possibility to be faced; there were seven
feet of water in the engine-room, and only the stout
hearts of her captain and crew knew all the dangers
of their long watch and ward. As the transport
entered the Tyne a blizzard swept over the country.
We who waited for news on shore wondered where
on the cold grey seas laboured the ship bringing
home ‘Dr. Elsie and her unit.’</p>

<p>In her last hours she told her own people of the
closing days on board:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘When we left Orkney we had a dreadful passage,
and even after we got into the river it was very rough.
We were moored lower down, and, owing to the high
wind and storm, a big liner suddenly bore down upon us,
and came within a foot of cutting us in two, when our
moorings broke, we swung round, and were saved. I
said to the one who told me&mdash;“Who cut our moorings?”
She answered, “No one cut them, they broke.”’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was a pause, and then to her own she
broke the knowledge that she had heard the call
and was about to obey the summons.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘The same hand who cut our moorings then is
cutting mine now, and I am going forth.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Her niece Evelyn Simson notes how they heard
of the arrival:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘A wire came on Friday from Aunt Elsie, saying
they had arrived in Newcastle. We tried all
Saturday to get news by wire and ’phone, but got
none. We think now this was because the first
news came by wireless, and they did not land till
Sunday.</p>

<p>‘Aunt Elsie answered our prepaid wire, simply
saying, “I am in bed, do not telephone for a few days.”
I was free to start off by the night train, and arrived
about 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> at Newcastle. I found the S.W.H. were
at the Station Hotel, and I saw Aunt Elsie’s name in the
book. I did not like to disturb her at that hour, and
went to my room till 7.30. I found her alone; the night
nurse was next door. She was surprised to see me,
as she thought it would be noon before any one could
arrive. She looked terribly wasted, but she gave me
such a strong embrace that I never thought the illness
was more than what might easily be cured on land, with
suitable diet.</p>

<p>‘I felt her pulse, and she said. “It is not very good,
Eve dear, I know, for I have a pulse that beats in my
head, and I know it has been dropping beats all night.”
She wanted to know all about every one, and we had a
long talk before any one came in. She told me how
good Dr. Ward had been to her, always, and we arranged
that Dr. Ethel Williams should come. Aunt Elsie
then packed me off to get some breakfast, and Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Ward told me she was much worse than she had been
the night before.</p>

<p>‘I telephoned to Edinburgh saying she was “very
ill.” When Dr. Williams came, I learnt that there
was practically no hope of her living. They started
injections and oxygen, and Aunt Elsie said, “Now
don’t think we didn’t think of all these things before,
but on board ship nothing was possible.”</p>

<p>‘It was not till Dr. Williams’ second visit that she
asked me if the doctor thought “this was the end.”
When she saw that it was so, she at once said, without
pause or hesitation, “Eve, it will be grand starting a new
job over there,”&mdash;then, with a smile, “although there
are two or three jobs here I would like to have finished.”
After this her whole mind seemed taken up with the
sending of last messages to her committees, units,
friends, and relations. It simply amazed me how she
remembered every one down to her grand-nieces and
nephews. When I knew mother and Aunt Eva were
on their way, I told her, and she was overjoyed. Early
in the morning she told me wonderful things about
bringing back the Serbs. I found it very hard to
follow, as it was an unknown story to me. I clearly
remember she went one day to the Consul in Odessa,
and said she must wire certain things. She was told
she could only wire straight to the War Office&mdash;“and
so I got into touch straight with the War Office.”</p>

<p>‘Mrs. M‘Laren at one moment commented&mdash;“You
have done magnificent work.” Back swiftly came her
answer, “Not I, but my unit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Mrs. M‘Laren says: ‘Mrs. Simson and I arrived at
Newcastle on Monday evening. It was a glorious
experience to be with her those last two hours. She
was emaciated almost beyond recognition, but all sense
of her bodily weakness was lost in the grip one felt of
the strong alert spirit, which dominated every one in
the room. She was clear in her mind, and most loving
to the end. The words she greeted us with were&mdash;“So,
I am going over to the other side.” When she saw we
could not believe it, she said, with a smile, “For a
long time I <em>meant</em> to live, but now I <em>know</em> I am going.”
She spoke naturally and expectantly of going over.
Certainly she met the unknown with a cheer! As the
minutes passed she seemed to be entering into some
great experience, for she kept repeating, “This is
wonderful&mdash;but this is wonderful.” Then, she would
notice that some one of us was standing, and she would
order us to sit down&mdash;another chair must be brought
if there were not enough. To the end, she would revert
to small details for our comfort. As flesh and heart
failed, she seemed to be breasting some difficulty, and
in her own strong way, without distress or fear, she
asked for help, “You must all of you help me through
this.” We repeated to her many words of comfort.
Again and again she answered back, “I know.” One,
standing at the foot of the bed, said to her, “You will
give my love to father”; instantly the humorous smile
lit her face, and she answered, “Of course I will.”</p>

<p>‘At her own request her sister read to her words of
the life beyond&mdash;“Let not your heart be troubled&mdash;In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not
so I would have told you,” and, even as they watched
her, she fell on sleep.</p>

<p>‘After she had left us, there remained with those
that loved her only a great sense of triumph and
perfect peace. The room seemed full of a glorious
presence. One of us said, “This is not death; it
makes one wish to follow after.”’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As ‘We’ waited those anxious weeks for the
news of the arrival of Dr. Inglis and her Army, there
were questionings, how we should welcome and show
her all love and service. The news quickly spread
she was not well&mdash;might be delayed in reaching
London; the manner of greeting her must be to
ensure rest.</p>

<p>The storm had spent itself, and the moon was
riding high in a cloudless heaven, when others
waiting in Edinburgh on the 26th learnt the news
that she too had passed through the storm and
shadows, and had crossed the bar.</p>

<p>That her work here was to end with her life had
not entered the minds of those who watched for her
return, overjoyed to think of seeing her face once
more. She had concealed her mortal weakness so
completely, that even to her own the first note of
warning had come with the words that she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
landed, but was in bed:&mdash;‘then we thought it was
time one of us should go to her.’</p>

<p>Her people brought her back to the city of her
fathers, and to the hearts who had sent her forth,
and carried her on the wings of their strong confidence.
There was to be no more going forth of
her active feet in the service of man, and all that
was mortal was carried for the last time into the
church she had loved so well. Then we knew and
understood that she had been called where His
servants shall serve Him.</p>

<p>The Madonna lilies, the lilies of France and of the
fields, were placed around her. Over her hung the
torn banners of Scotland’s history. The Scottish
women had wrapped their country’s flag around
them in one of their hard-pressed flights. On her
coffin, as she lay looking to the East in high <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Giles’, were placed the flags of Great Britain and
Serbia.</p>

<p>She had worn ‘the faded ribbons’ of the orders
bestowed on her by France, Russia, and Serbia. It
has often been asked at home and abroad why she
had received no decorations at the hands of her
Sovereign. It is not an easy question to answer.</p>

<p>On November the 29th, Dr. Inglis was buried,
amid marks of respect and recognition which make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
that passing stand alone in the history of the last
rites of any of her fellow-citizens. Great was the
company gathered within the church. The chancel
was filled by her family and relatives&mdash;her Suffrage
colleagues, representatives from all the societies,
the officials of the hospitals and hostels she had
founded at home, the units whom she had led and
by whose aid she had done great things abroad.
Last and first of all true-hearted mourners the people
of Serbia represented by their Minister and members
of the Legation. The chief of the Scottish Command
was present, and by his orders military honours were
paid to this happy warrior of the Red Cross.</p>

<p>The service had for its keynote the Hallelujah
Chorus, which was played as the procession left <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Giles’. It was a thanksgiving instinct with triumph
and hope. The Resurrection and the Life was in
prayer and praise. The Dean of the Order of the
Thistle revealed the thoughts of many hearts in
his farewell words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>‘We are assembled this day with sad but proud
and grateful hearts to remember before God a very
dear and noble lady, our beloved sister, Elsie Inglis,
who has been called to her rest. We mourn only for
ourselves, not for her. She has died as she lived, in the
clear light of faith and self-forgetfulness, and now her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
name is linked for ever with the great souls who have
led the van of womanly service for God and man. A
wondrous union of strength and tenderness, of courage
and sweetness, she remains for us a bright and noble
memory of high devotion and stainless honour.
Especially to-day, in the presence of representatives of
the land for which she died, we think of her as an
immortal link between Serbia and Scotland, and as a
symbol of that high courage which will sustain us,
please God, till that stricken land is once again restored,
and till the tragedy of war is eradicated and crowned
with God’s great gifts of peace and of righteousness.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The buglers of the Royal Scots sounded ‘the
Reveille to the waking morn,’ and the coffin with
the Allied flags was placed on the gun carriage.
Women were in the majority of the massed crowd
that awaited the last passing. ‘Why did they no
gie her the V.C.?’ asked the shawl-draped women
holding the bairns of her care: these and many
another of her fellow-citizens lined the route and
followed on foot the long road across the city. As
the procession was being formed, Dr. Inglis’ last
message was put into the hands of the members of
the London Committee for S.W.H. It ran:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="address_date">
‘<i>November 26, 1917.</i>
</p>

<p>‘So sorry I cannot come to London. Dr. Williams
and Dr. Ward are agreed, and quite rightly. Will send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Gwynn in a day or two with explanations and suggestions.
Colonel Miliantinovitch and Colonel Tcholah
Antitch were to make appointment this week or next
from Winchester; do see them, and also as many of the
committee as possible and show them every hospitality.
They have been very kind to us, and whatever happens,
dear Miss Palliser, do beg the Committee to make sure
that they (the Serbs) have their hospitals and transport,
for they do need them.</p>

<p>‘Many thanks to the Committee for their kindness
to me and their support of me.</p>

<p class="signed">‘<span class="smcap">Elsie Inglis.</span></p>

<p>‘Dictated to Miss Evelyn Simson.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How the people loved her! was the thought, as
she passed through the grief-stricken crowds.
These, who knew her best, smiled as they said one
to another, ‘How all this would surprise her!’</p>

<p>Edinburgh is a city of spires and of God’s acres,
the graves cut in the living rock, within gardens and
beside running waters. Across the Water of Leith
the long procession wound its way. Within sight
of the grave, it was granted to her grateful brethren,
the representatives of the Serbian nation, to carry
her coffin, and lower it to the place where the mortal
in her was to lie in its last rest. Her life’s story was
grouped around her&mdash;the Serbian officers, the military
of her own nation at war, the women comrades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of the common cause, the poor and suffering&mdash;to
one and all she had been the inspiring succourer.</p>

<p class="space_below">November mists had drifted all day across the
city, veiling the fortress strength of Scotland, and
the wild wastes of seas over which she had returned
home to our island strength. Even as we turned
and left her, the grey clouds at eventide were transfused
and glorified by the crimson glow of the
sunset on the hills of Time.</p>

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no

  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
